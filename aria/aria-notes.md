THE THING TO FIGURE OUT FOR THIS BOOK IS WHETHER YOU CAN TELL AN ARCHETYPAL STORY
IN A WAY THAT FEELS FRESH, AND NOT CLICHE.


Notes for The Song


A man working for a technology company has an idea and fights to get it into the product, but is ostracized, and eventually fired.
He starts his own company and sees the new idea come to fruition, success, then corruption by those who misunderstand the spirit of it.

A story about the lifecycle of a new idea. Very spare, minimal - showing the world of corporate tech vs startup. Minimal but specific to a world. A new way of communicating via an amalgam of words/video/voice into something like music

One (10,000 words)
  Has the idea, tries to get it implemented, is fired
Two (10,000 words)
  Starts his own company, develops the idea, releases it, is successful
Three (10,000 words)
  Dies from Cancer, but releases the algorithm on GitHub others take over the company, the idea is corrupted with the best intentions, loses marketshare and is forgotten, yet a young intern sees the beauty in there somewhere, strips it out, and decides to strike out on his own, calling his idea Aria. Forks it on GitHub.

"There was something about it, simple and true."


It's called The Song. Think of it as an allegory in the vein of The Old Man and the Sea or Animal Farm or The Stranger -- very minimally told, and short.

Thematically it is the story of how a new idea is introduced into the world. 

Plot-wise it is about a programmer at a huge corporate tech company (think Microsoft) who has a revolutionary idea for their existing social network software. His idea is basically a new form of communication using an amalgam of text, photos, video, and audio. He calls it The Song. So he goes through the political and bureaucratic channels to try to get managers interested in the idea, but everybody thinks its stupid, too difficult, not practical, or odd. So he gets frustrated, and eventually (from being too persistent) fired. 

So he decides to create a startup around the idea, with a couple guys from the company who thought it was cool. So they bootstrap a product called Song App, but it gets to a point where they need some money so they take investment. But the investors have all these ideas (like putting ads in the Song communication stream) and the programmer has to fight them off and eventually give back the money. Then, finally, when he is broke, and the other team members have left for paying jobs, the app is finally finished and released, and is a complete sensation. It does revolutionize mass communication, and makes a trillion dollars, goes IPO, all that stuff.

Then the story flash forwards fifteen years, and we learn the programmer has a terminal form of cancer. He makes arrangements as to who is going to run the company after he's gone, and finally dies. After his death, the new CEO tries the best he can but step by step they start to ruin simple idea behind The Song (first thing they do is introduce ads) and make it less and less the original idea. The company declines and loses its cool, no more users, and goes bankrupt, is bought out.

A coda ends the book, where five years later a young programmer is reading about old technologies and finds The Song App, and realizes it would be a good idea if the ads (and other crap) were stripped away.

Make each book have its own story arc, with rising tension, resolved in the final section. Do not use exposition unless necessary. Write scenes. The writing should be true to the world. Talk about code, about investment, use the terminology of the world to make it real, concrete. Forget the overall theme. Just tell the story in the tightest, most compelling way you can.


A friend from the start, the only one who understands, an unintentional betrayer in the end

The company is on track to go IPO, not yet monetized in a meaningful way. Not sustainable.


David did not believe in God or any kind of higher power. He had never considered it important. And yet in that moment he felt compelled to kneel beside his car in the parking lot.

"Please. Don't take it from me. Not now. Let me live so that I can give it life. Let me live that long."

"Don't take it from me. Not now. Let me live so that I can give it life."

Brandon found the code difficult to understand, but it was commented here and there. No watchers. Fascinating stuff. He named it The Song.

He uses the Aria stream on his friend and understood that he would be betrayed.
His partner betrays him, commits suicide after visiting the grave, "Forgive me."

His friend goes behind his back, integrates ads for demo purposes. He experiences it, a toothpaste ad, and during the remainder of the story buys toothpaste at random.

Elliptical storytelling, lean, minimal. Be smart, authentic, concise.

At night he would try to understand how it worked, a memory imprint on the data streams. Perhaps the native americans were right all along, and your spirit somehow is captured. But soon he would reach the limit of his knowledge, like hitting a wall. Leave it to smarter men and women to figure out.



‘Be careful not to wager too much before you’re certain it will succeed’.
‘If this wasn’t your first startup, you’d make fewer mistakes.’
‘When you hit bumps, successful entrepreneurs keep going’.
Either my idea was insane — too far out there, crazy, bizarre. “Why would anyone buy that?”

Or, it was old news — been done before, isn’t that special. “Don’t pants like that exist, and aren’t they called Dockers?”

But there is one comment that has forever stuck with me. A conversation that went like this:

Me: “I want to make a new kind of wrinkle-free pants that are cool instead of stodgy and are so wrinkle free they can be worn for multiple days in a row without care.”

My friend: “That’s your idea?”

“Yeah, and I’m super passionate about it, too.”

“Do you have another 59 ideas lined up?”

“No, what do you mean?”

“Well, I read it takes the average entrepreneur 60 tries before they’re successful, so I’m wondering what you plan to do next?”

OUCH!


That afternoon at work David accidentally clicked on a video file in his text editor and saw columns of sequenced numbers.

Does not have a girlfriend. Longs to forget everything and enjoy life.



David worked at Microdyne as a programmer. Microdyne was the company behind FaceSpace, the most popular social network on the Internet. Over six billion people used FaceSpace to communicate on a daily basis. David's work at Microdyne involved multimedia persistence for FaceSpace, which meant storage and archival of all the photos, video, and audio which was uploaded to the network on a daily basis. Terabytes of data per day. It fascinated him to see various the ways people communicated through FaceSpace. 

David loved his work, was well paid, respected by his family and friends, and adored by his girlfriend Anna, a researcher at the CDC. He had a good life, and did not take it for granted.


do not tell the story, immerse in the world.

Fractal algorithms
Has a dream about communicated where he is on a wavelength never before achieved
First chapter ends with clarity of the idea, something musical and personal at the same time, like a poem. Like a song.

Fractal algorithms, generative synthesis, advanced image processing, incrementally the pieces had been dropped into place by smarter men and women. David only had to reach out and assemble them.

A discovery like the one who first discovered fire, able to harness it but unable to explain the science behind it. Perhaps not for a thousand years. Yet it was here.

David calls himself and the other founders, custodians, out of humility.

Aria allows communication within the language, since it depends on language, but he has just cracked the algorithm to allow worldwide communication. The founders use the argument of a custodian against him, to not allow the algorithm out. To protect it. They are wealthy but want more. By introducing advertisements into the Aria stream, a new level of product awareness could be achieved.

An arc of three books, each broken into three chapters, with their own rise and falls




HE DOES NOT DIE OF CANCER. HE IS MURDERED BY A RELIGIOUS FANATIC.
STORY SHOULD ALSO BE ABOUT WORKING IN A CORPORATE OFFICE, THEN A STARTUP.
