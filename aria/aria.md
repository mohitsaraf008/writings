I.

That afternoon at work David accidentally clicked on a video file in his text editor and saw columns of sequenced numbers.

Does not have a girlfriend. Longs to forget everything and enjoy life.



David worked at Microdyne as a programmer. Microdyne was the company behind FaceSpace, the most popular social network on the Internet. Over six billion people used FaceSpace to communicate on a daily basis. David's work at Microdyne involved multimedia persistence for FaceSpace, which meant storage and archival of all the photos, video, and audio which was uploaded to the network on a daily basis. Terabytes of data per day. It fascinated him to see various the ways people communicated through FaceSpace. 

David loved his work, was well paid, respected by his family and friends, and adored by his girlfriend Anna, a researcher at the CDC. He had a good life, and did not take it for granted.

Fractal algorithms, generative synthesis, advanced image processing, incrementally the pieces had been dropped into place by smarter men and women. David only had to reach out and assemble them.

A discovery like the one who first discovered fire, able to harness it but unable to explain the science behind it. Perhaps not for a thousand years. Yet it was here.

David calls himself and the other founders, custodians, out of humility.

Aria allows communication within the language, since it depends on language, but he has just cracked the algorithm to allow worldwide communication. The founders use the argument of a custodian against him, to not allow the algorithm out. To protect it. They are wealthy but want more. By introducing advertisements into the Aria stream, a new level of product awareness could be achieved.

An arc of three books, each broken into three chapters, with their own rise and falls
