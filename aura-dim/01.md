AURA DIM

"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she said, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her, "but we've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

but a pair of glassy eyes. 
Raise my feelings one more time."

Chapter One : The Notebook

  Not one minute before 2:15 in the morning the beams of a beat-to-hell Dodge Dart lit up the concrete walls behind the abandoned strip mall where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. They were tweakers for sure, but punctual tweakers, and so he liked them. Grady and Jenn. But maybe like was too strong a word. At least he never ignored their desperate texts to 'hook it up?' this time of night like he would most his other customers. Their text had also asked if they could 'double dip' so they must have come into some cash since last Tuesday. That was no problem for him and he had texted them back a simple '$$' before setting the time and place. But as soon as he saw their Dart creep past the garbage bins he got a bad feeling inside, like something deep in his gut, and nearly drove off before they even spotted him. Instead he reached under his seat and pulled out the gun he kept there and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. Then he flashed his lights three times, very slow. They answered his flashes and then switched off their lights and drove to the corner where he was parked.
  The girl got out first, approached him, the kindly look in her eyes giving it away.
  "Sup babydoll, how you been, Will?"
  "Jenn."
  Then to Grady, taking his time to join them.
  "It's cold out here. Let's do this."
  "That you gave us last time was straight," she broke in with a  gap-toothed grin, her voice uncouth, harsher than a female voice should be at her age. At one time she had been attractive.
  "Yeah?"
  "Mmmhmmm".
  "Not like you guys twice in one week."
  Grady joined his girl and put his arm around the small of her back. He had some bundle tucked under his arm, wrapped up in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "Tell him babe."
  Grady gave a look like he was going to hit her.
  "I'm gonna tell him, babe. Shut the fuck up. This ain't no fucking game."
  He palmed the handle of the gun in his pocket.
  "Look, you got three seconds to tell me what's in that bag or we're gonna have a problem. What is it?"
  "It's cool, Will, it's cool. Chill out man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't fucking tell me to chill out at two o clock in the morning out here. Tell me what's in that goddamn bag or else I don't know what. At the very least I'm gone and you two ain't never gonna see me again. You can believe that!"
  They grew panic-eyed.
  "Will, dude, it's just a notebook. A notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Jenn said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
	"Don't blame me."
	He wrapped his finger on the trigger inside the pocket and regarded the both of them. The sores around their mouths and eyes, the bitten nails, the malnourished bodies and greasy hair.   A sorry sight. Yet all he felt in the moment was an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with them, in the cold in the night in a place like this.
	"A notebook?"
	"Show him," she said.
	Grady watched him, his eyes asking if it was okay.
	He nodded.
	Grady set the wrapped package onto the hood of his car and peeled the bag off. All the time he kept his eyes on him and more importantly on the hand in the jacket pocket. Grady was not naive, just strung out. In a moment he had the wrapping off and held it out.
	"A computer?"
	"Yeah, a notebook. Notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
	"Laptop," Jenn said.
	"Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," Grady said, "It's a really nice computer we got ahold of. Apple brand. See?"
	He noticed the logo on the lid of the machine.
	"This thing, you could sell on Craigslist for a grand. A grand easy. We looked it up."
	"But we were thinking," Jenn stepped in, her voice softening, taking on a persuasive tone, "to save time, what if you let us give it to you, in exchange for a double? Then you could make a ton off just this one deal. All you have to do is sell it."
	"It works, we tried it out. We can show you how it works."
	The photograph came into focus and he could see what was happening here. The tension and unease he felt relaxed. His finger on the gun in his pocket relaxed. There was no conspiracy here, no LEO on a sting, or thugs around the corner waiting to pounce. Just a pair of fiends trying to pawn some loot on their man.
	"Let me check it out. Open it. Turn it on."
	Grady lit up.
	"Sure thing. Let me show you the screen on this bad boy. It looks sharp. This is top of the line right here. They don't make em any better than this."
	The computer was nice, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings. The keys all seemed to work. When Grady turned it on it went to a lock screen, with a single user account, the avatar a picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to notice. No matter about the lock, there were ways around that.
	He stood back and considered the proposal. Honestly there wasn't much to consider. This was a solid machine. He had no doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. These fiends also knew how much it was worth, it was just that the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix, simply, and only tonight would do. So the standing back was a posture to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting the offer. To have that to hold over them in the future.
	"So whatcha think?" Jenn finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. Grady nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widened in her direction. But he said nothing, just waited.
	The man looked at them both and ran his hand along the outside of the notebook and closed the lid. He picked it up and weighed it in hand.
	
	Inside he set the Apple computer on the little desk, then went to the kitchenette with the pint of rye and a sackful of Krystals. He poured two fingers into a dirty glass, added a splash of water from the faucet, and lay back on the bed with the drink and the burgers and ate and drank, flipping through the stations on the basic cable that came with the room. After, his gut was full and the drink was already going to his head. He knew in the morning he would regret the bad food and possibly the drink but as of now he hadn't had too much. He poured another and paced the floor of the hotel room.
	His mind was full of the whisky and Krystals and he felt like going for a walk. He felt like walking would clear his mind, but he didn't go out. He stayed there in the small room and thought about Grady and Jenn. Someday soon he would be out of this selling to the junkies business and up and up, not having to deal with the day to day. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control over his life, might move out of this shithole and get a real place again. He thought about what Grady and Jean were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the meth, there on the couch in their piece of shit trailer out in Kingston. He thought about how they had once been in love and even made love while taking it. 
	It was then his stomach turned and he ran to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet, the chunks of undigested bun and bread making him wretch more. This place and the cigarette smoke. Always the smell. He blamed it on that. Soon he would have his own place again and no smoking there. No sickening smoke smell to make you wretch in your more drunken moments. He got up and brushed his teeth and washed his face. He looked at himself in the mirror.
	"What does she see in him?" He said aloud, thinking of Jenn, the lack of any other female in his life placing her on some undeserved pedestal in his present psyche. He remembered her wonderful curves, before the turn, before she became the strung-out skeleton he saw tonight.
	Then he went to the kitchenette and poured another drink.
