The Notebook

Here I sit, parked behind the old Jubilee Plaza strip mall, waiting for them to arrive. The best thing going for the old Jubilee is a Big Lots that opened in 1992. Next would be the furniture outlet that’s been going out of business for two years at least, the neon signs plastered in the windows faded and peeling off now. Most familiar to me is the remains of an old Mexican restaurant where I got food poisoning in seventh grade, puked my guts out for an entire Saturday. Las Portales, chile rellenos, never again. Grass coming up through cracks in the faded asphault. And that’s the good side. Back here is an area that seems created to remind you of all things hopeless and sad in this world. Beige concrete back of the stores, where trucks make their deliveries, power meters, rusted-out garbage bins, piles of cigarette butts, bad corners that lead nowhere, just end in a blank wall. Only a single amber light still works and bathes the place in a gloomy shade of orange-brown. You might wonder why all this description and I don't have a good answer for that, except that I'm bored as shit waiting for these fuckers. It's been an hour since their last text.

This is how it works, in case you ever have a mind to.
