AURA DIM

"Here, at any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, 
pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following 
our whims; it's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this 
Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy...remember 
my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted 
from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

The Notebook

  Not one minute before 2:15 in the morning the beams of a beat-to-hell Dodge Dart lit up the concrete walls behind the abandoned 
strip mall where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. They were tweakers for sure, but punctual ones, and so he liked 
Grady and Jenn. Well maybe like was too strong a word. At least he never ignored their desperate texts to 'hook it up?' this time of night 
like he would most other customers. Their text had also asked to 'double dip' so they must have come into some cash since last Tuesday. 
That was no problem and he had texted back a simple, '$$', before setting the time and place. But as soon as he saw their car pull around he 
got a bad feeling inside, like something deep in his gut, and nearly drove off before they could spot him. Instead he reached under his seat 
and pulled out the gun he kept there and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. Then he flashed his lights very slowly three times. They answered his 
flashes and then switched off their lights and drove to the corner where he was parked.





























After returning from the deal with the laptop he looks out the window because 
the mexican who works the night shift at the office is beating on the door of the 
family across the way, the pimp next door is yelling at his girl, the pool with 
the brown tarp peeled back over dark green water, reminds him of a Florida vacation he 
took with his dad and brother and sister when they were just kids. They wore orange 
floatation balloons on their arms in the blue water of the pool and the sky was very blue against the 
white clouds. How clearly he could still recall it and even smell it and hear it and then he felt an 
emptiness within him at how far he was from those happy days and how fun that had all been and how his 
life would never again be so much fun. Then he thought of his own son whom he had not seen since last 
October and what he was doing right now and if he would ever think back on him as he thought back
his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

I can't help you.
