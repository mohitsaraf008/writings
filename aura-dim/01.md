"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "But we've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

CHAPTER ONE
The Notebook

  Not one minute before two in the morning the headlights from an old Dodge Dart spread up the walls of the alleyway behind the abandoned Huffaker Crossing strip mall, where the Kroger used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. They were tweakers these two, but reliable customers, so he didn't ignore their desperate text to 'hook it up?' like he would most others this late on a Tuesday. But part of that was he had gone to school with the girl back in the day and that gave him a sense of obligation he could not explain. They asked for a ball tonight so they must have come into some cash since last time. He remembered them scrimping for an eighth. The ball was no problem so long as they had the cash and he texted back '$$$' before setting the time and place for the meet. That was two hours ago. 
  But when he finally saw the shadow of their car emerge from the side of the building, he got a bad feeling and nearly drove off. But he didn't. Instead he reached under his seat and pulled out the small Colt he kept there and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. He flashed his beams three times. The Dodge stopped where it was on the other side of the alley. A few seconds went by and then it flashed back three times before pulling into the corner where he was parked. There was a little ambient light from the amber pole lights further down. Nothing else.
  The girl got out first, tight jeans and a black halter, exposed midriff with visible stretchmarks, the kindness in her eyes a giveaway. Something was up.
  "Sup, babydoll," she greeted him, "How you doin?"
  "Jenn."
  Then to the boyfriend who was taking his sweet time with something in the car.
  "Yo, it's cold out here, man. Let's do this thing."
  "Dude, that you gave us last time was straight," she interrupted with a crooked grin, the sound of her voice uncouth, harsher than a female voice should be at that age.
  "Yeah?"
  "Mmmhmmm, we was geeked up good."
  The boyfriend got out and slid up next to his girl. He put his arm around her waist. The man noticed some kind of bundle tucked underneath his arm, wrapped in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?" He asked.
  "Tell him babe."
  The boyfriend gave a look like he was going to hit her.
  "Jenn, I got this."
  The man palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "I said, what's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, James, it's cool. Chill man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill. Just tell me what's in that bag under your arm. Right now. Or I'm gone."
  The boyfriend glanced at the jacket pocket, assuming what his hand grasped inside. His eyes grew panicked and then he lifted both hands in an effort to calm the situation.
  "James, dude, it's just a notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Jenn said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
  "Don't blame me," she said, cupping both hands over a lighter, with a fresh cigarette dangling in her mouth. She lit and blew the smoke into the air. The sores around her mouths and eyes, the bitten nails with flaking polish, the stringy hair. He had a glimpse from their school days, her sitting in Algebra, behind him, shoe dangling off her foot, bored. 
  Suddenly he felt an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with the both of them, out in the cold, out in the night in this place.
  "A notebook? What are you talking about?" He said.
  "Show him, Grady."
  The boyfriend watched him, his eyes asking permission before moving. He granted it.
  The boyfriend set the package onto the hood of his car and unwrapped the bag. All the time he kept his eyes on the hand in the jacket pocket. He was not naive, just strung out. In a moment he had the bag off and held the machine out to him.
  "A computer?"
  "A notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
  "It's a laptop, hon."
  "Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," he said, "It's a real nice one. No scratches or dings. Works good."
  The man regarded the computer but said nothing.
  "This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up."
  "But then we got to thinking," she stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for the ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one deal. Just this one time, from now on we have cash."
  The boyfriend interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, we tried it out. We can show you, its got battery left. No cord though. But you can get one of them at the Wal-Mart for cheap."
  The man understood. His finger released the trigger on the gun. There was no conspiracy here, no LEO on a sting, no thugs around the corner. Just some fiends desperate to pawn some loot for a big fix.
  "Turn it on," he said.
  The boyfriend grinned stupidly.
  "Sure thing, James. Let me show you how bright the screen be on this bad boy. Picture look sharp too. Top of the line right here. They don't make em any better."
  The computer was nice, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches like he said. The keys all seemed to work. When the boyfriend turned it on and it went to a lock screen, he noticed a single user account, the avatar a picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to see. That was not his concern.
  The stood back and considered their proposal, but there wasn't much to consider. This could work. He had no doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. These tweakers also knew how much it was worth, it was just the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that good fix and only tonight would do. So him standing back was a pose to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting their offer. To have that in the future to hold over them.
  "Whatcha think?" The girl finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. Her boyfriend nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widened in her direction, afraid she might blow the deal.
  The man regarded them both and ran his hand along the outside of the notebook and the keys and closed the lid. He picked it up and carefully weighed it in hand.
	
  Inside, he set the computer on the little desk and then went to the kitchenette with the pint of rye whiskey and a sackful of Krystals. He poured two fingers into a used glass from the sink, added an ice cube, and then lay back on the bed with the drink and the burgers, absently flipping through stations on the basic cable that came with the room. 
  Afterwards, his gut was stuffed and his head was already swimming. He knew in the morning he would regret the bad food and possibly the drink, but as of now he hadn't had too much. He went to the kitchenette and poured another, smaller drink, and paced the floor of his room. Someday soon he would be out of this selling to the junkies business and up and up, not having to deal with the day to day anymore. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control over his own life, might move out of this shithole and get a real place again, a regular place. Get another dog. He thought about what Grady and Jean were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the meth, there on the couch in their piece of shit trailer out in Kingston. He thought about how they had once been in love and even made love while taking it. Then his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and threw up in the toilet, the chunks of undigested Krystal meat and onions in the bowl making him wretch even more. This place and the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He blamed it on that. Soon he would have his own place again and no smoking there. No sickening smoke smell to make you wretch in your more drunken moments. He got up and brushed his teeth and washed his face. He looked at himself in the mirror, washed his face. "What's she see in that loser?" He said aloud, thinking of his former schoolmate, the lack of any other female in his world placing her on some pedestal in his present psyche. He remembered her wonderful curves, before the meth, before she became the strung-out wraith he saw tonight. He went to the kitchenette and poured another.
