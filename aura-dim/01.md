"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

The Notebook

  It was a cold night in January, just before two a.m. Headlights from a vintage Dodge lit up the alley behind Huffaker Crossing, an abandoned strip mall where the Krogers used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. The beams shined into his pickup cabin, blinding him, as the the car pulled to a stop and went dark. Two hours ago a tweaker named Grady had texted had him out of the blue, asking for an 8 ball. That meant he and his girl Tina must have come into some cash since the last time they did business. He remembered that last time, before Christmas, the red eyes, the crumpled dollars handed over with pale, trembling hands. But an 8 ball was no problem, no problem at all, so long as you had the cash. That was the question. *Waiting for the man*. Bullshit. These days you showed up before the other guy. Have to scope things out. Have to be smart. Not be stupid. You let your guard down even for a second, and you're asking for that gun blast to your brain, that switchblade in your liver.
  Nobody moved at first. Nobody made a sound. It was so quiet they could hear the sleet falling onto the vehicles, the wind moaning through the power and phone cables swinging overhead. Paint flaking off the corners of the doors and the concrete pylons that shielded the air conditioning units, rust in those places. Everything cast in amber hue, from a pole at the other end of the corridor. Behind the alley was a thin tree line, behind which was an unused railroad track and beyond that a trailer park of Mexicans. At last the man in the pickup donned his hood, zipped up his jacket, and got out slowly, his right hand on a revolver in his right jacket pocket. He walked around to the passenger side, opened the door, motioned for the girl to slide over. He got in.
  [They are afraid of him, treating him like a dangerous animal, he senses it, feels glad]
  The girlfriend got out first, tight jeans, black halter, an exposed midriff even in this cold, visible stretch marks, the kindness in her eyes a giveaway. She greeted him.
  "Tina."
  Then he spoke to the boyfriend who was taking his sweet time with something in the car.
  "It's cold man. Let's do this thing."
  "Dude, what you gave us last time was straight," the girlfriend interrupted with a grin, the sound of her voice uncouth, gravelly, harsher than a female voice should be at her age.
  "Good."
  The boyfriend got out and slid up next to her. He put his arm around her waist. The man noticed some kind of bundle tucked underneath his arm, wrapped in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?" He asked.
  "Tell him babe."
  The boyfriend gave a look like he was going to slap her down.
  "I got this."
  The man palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, Will, it's cool. Chill man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill. Just tell me what's in that bag under your arm. Right now. Or I'm gone."
  The boyfriend glanced at the jacket pocket, assuming what his hand grasped inside. His eyes grew panicked and then he lifted both hands in an effort to calm the situation.
  "Will, dude, it's just a notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Tina said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
  "Don't blame me," she said, cupping both hands over a lighter, with a fresh cigarette dangling in her mouth. She lit and blew the smoke into the air. The sores around her mouths and eyes, the bitten nails with flaking polish, the stringy hair. He had a glimpse from their school days, her sitting in Algebra, behind him, shoe dangling off her foot, bored. 
  Suddenly he felt an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with the both of them, out in the cold, out in the night in this place.
  "What do you mean a notebook? What are you talking about?"
  "Show him."
  The boyfriend watched him, his eyes asking permission before moving. The man granted it.
  He set the package down on the hood of his car and unwrapped it. All the time he kept his eyes on his jacket pocket. He was not naive, Grady, just strung out. In a moment he had the bag off and held it out to him.
  "A computer?"
  "A notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
  "It's a laptop, hon."
  "Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," he said, "It's a real nice one, as you can see. No scratches or dings or nothin. Works good too."
  The man regarded the computer but said nothing, just looked at them.
  "This thing you could sell on Craigslist for a thousand bucks. A thousand easy. We looked it up online."
  "But then we got to thinking," she stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you in exchange for the ball? Then you could make a ton off just this one trade. Just this one time, you know. From now on we have cash."
  The boyfriend interrupted, selling it.
  "It works good, we tried it out. We can show you, its even got some battery left. No cord though. But you can get one of them at the Wal-Mart for cheap."
  The man understood. His finger relaxed on the trigger. There was no conspiracy, no LEO, no thugs around the corner, waiting to pounce. Just some fiends desperate to pawn off some loot for a fix.
  "Turn it on," he said to them.
  The boyfriend nodded.
  "Sure thing, Will. Let me show you how bright the screen be on this bad boy. Picture look sharp too. Top of the line right here. Don't make em any better."
  The computer was a nice one, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches like he said. Keys all there, seemed to work. When it came on there was a bright green lock screen, and the noticed a single user account with an avatar showing picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to see.
  He stood back and considered their proposal, but there wasn't much to consider. No doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. The tweakers also knew how much it was worth. It was just the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix to geek out and only tonight would do. So him standing back was a pose to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting the offer, to have that to hold over them when the time came.
  "Whatcha think?" The girlfriend finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. The boyfriend nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widening in her direction, afraid she might blow the whole deal and they would have to endure the night sober.
  He regarded them both with careful eyes and then ran his fingers along the outside of the notebook and over the keyboard and then closed the lid.
  	
  Inside, he set the notebook on the desk and then went to the kitchenette with the pint of rye and a sackful of Krystals. He poured two fingers into a used glass from the sink, added an ice cube, and then lay back on the bed with the drink and the burgers, absently flipping through the basic cable stations that came with the room.
  Soon he was stuffed, his head spinning. He knew in the morning he would regret the bad food and the liquor, but that was a fight for tomorrow. He stumbled to the kitchenette and poured another, smaller drink, and started to pace the hotel room. Someday soon he would be out of this selling to the junkies business and up and up, not having to deal with the day to day anymore. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control, might move out of this shithole and get a real place again, a regular place. Get a dog. He thought about what Grady and Tina were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the meth, there on the couch in their shit trailer out in Kingston. Obliterated, but in love. He remembered how he had once been in love. In that moment his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and chucked his meal into the toilet. It was this place, the filth, the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He blamed it on that. He rose and brushed his teeth and washed his face and looked at himself in the mirror.
  He went to the kitchenette and poured another drink. He looked at the clock. Four thirty. In a few hours it would be daylight and impossible anymore for him to sleep. The curtains were no good, there was a big area at the sides where the sunlight came in brighter than all hell. So he would be tired all tomorrow. He walked to the window overlooking the parking lot. In the office on the other side he saw the fluorescent lights on, the little Indian man who ran the hotel awake, drinking coffee. He was a hard worker. He reminded him a bit of Nanda, a man he used to work with at Beaulieu before they shut the doors in 2009. He had worked the extruder there for going on fifteen years. Had seniority, was always asked to train the new guys moving up from the floor. Nanda was on the sanitation team and they used to see each other all the time in the break room, do the old routine,
  "How's it hanging, Nanda?"
  The little guy then adjusted his crotch.
  "Little to the left today," he said, "Thanks for asking."
  Beaulieu was also where he met up with Glenn, who he used to go  out camping with up in Mentone, near Little River Canyon. Glenn was the one who introduced him to Danny, who sold him weed for their camping trips. And now he worked for Rodriguez from Kennesaw, who supplied Danny and now him. That's how it happens.
  Thinking of those times brought back memories of Carol and he felt that empty pang in his heart, the one he always felt whenever he imagined her with another man.
  He saw a car swerve into the lot and park sideways on the side opposite of his room. Two black men got out and went to door 104 and banged on it hard. The curtain in the room opened and then the door cracked but with the safety latch in place. One of the men stood back and kicked the door in. Then the both of them rushed inside and beat the shit out of the man inside. He assumed it was a man, all he saw was them huddled over some dark shape, punching and kicking as furiously as he had ever seen. A girl appeared in the door and shouted for help. The men rose and pushed her into the room, and then left. His eyes went to the Indian in the office, who was looking in the direction of the room, on the phone. The men came out, breathing hard, got in the car, and sped off. The entire thing didn't last more than a few minutes. He could see the man inside writhing on the floor, the girl hovering over him.
  He was far from it. Only dimly did he hear the sirens of the ambulance when it arrived. Everything was unreal. The room was spinning, so he sat down on the hard chair and put his head in his hands, but that only made the spinning worse. He wretched again and came back and lay on the bed. Thoughts of Carol and his old life, camping with Glenn, high as a kite and talking shit about the existence of God, his old job at the carpet mill. His boy.
  His eyes went to the television on the dresser. It was the news, a replay of the eleven o clock news. There had been an explosion at a research lab at the local college. Helicopter footage of the building in flames, charred debris at the windows and doorways, completely destroyed. No survivors the newswoman said. They showed pictures of them. Young, grad students. Then there was a cutaway to some video footage outside the place, a closeup of Grady and Tina, carrying a gasoline can and other tools into the building. He rose from the bed but the dizziness caused him to fall off. He got to his feet and slapped himself and tried to pay attention but he was too drunk, the details were slipping by him. Then there was some grainy footage of a vintage Dodge Dart driving off, the tail lights and smoke unmistakable. Then there was a number at the bottom of the screen to call for any information. Then the story was over and they moved on to the weather.
  His went to the computer on the dresser. He lifted the lid and turned it on. Once again he looked at the account avatar, the cute graphic of a DNA strand, and a username, z.jackson. It was password protected.
  From the corner of his eye he saw the red and blue flashing lights behind the curtain and in his drunken state he was startled by them. He knelt low and crawled to the window, peering out. It was only then he remembered the beating and the ambulance. Now two patrol cars were also in the parking lot, a group of them talking near room 104. He rose to his feet and saw others in other rooms watching, like him. The girl was crying, crossing her arms in the cold, giving a statement to one of the officers. The other officers in the group leered from the corner of their eyes. All she wore was a thin silk gown. He found himself also fixated on the shape of the woman, on her breasts through the gown, on her nipples through the silk.
  He remembered the first time they kissed, Spring break in Panama City Beach. He worked up the courage and asked her to walk the fishing pier with him. She said yes. After they went dancing. He was not the dancing type but he liked to dance with her. They walked down to the beach and he took a chance and kissed her slowly on the cheek, awkwardly. They dropped to the sand and he kissed her neck and looked up and saw her eyes closed in ecstasy. He lifted her shirt and kissed her smooth, pale stomach, lifted her bra and kissed her breasts. Then he kissed her deeply and could still remember how their embrace felt, close, as if two souls were holding onto the other at the edge of an abyss. He thought of their time together, then years later, just after the delivery of their son. It hurt him to think of his son. As much as it hurt to revisit these memories of her, it was unbearable to think of him, even when drunk. Especially then.
  The police were gone. The door to room 104 was closed. The woman in the silk robe nowhere to be seen. The Indian in the office was back to his coffee. Just over the roof of the hotel the sky was turning from night to a dim, pinkish gray color. Morning commuters in traffic on the road beside the hotel. His head had stopped spinning at last, but his mind was far from clear. His eyes landed on the pool in the center of the parking lot, unkept, unused in years, covered with a tarp partially blown open. Green, stagnant water lapped at the sides of the once ocean blue lining, now a hard plastic white. The sight of it took him to a vacation with his dad and brother and sister, to Fernandina beach when they were just kids. Though they had never seen the ocean they were more excited about the pool at the hotel and their dad reluctantly agreed to let them leave the beach to go there for the afternoon. How clearly he could still remember the smell of that water and the bright orange arm floats his little brother wore, only five. The brown siding of the hotel, the bright blue against it, looking up. The white clouds. It was all there as if it were yesterday, funny how clearly he could still recall that time and even smell it. Then a feeling inside of how far he was from those days, at how happy he had been then, at how fun it all was and how his life would never again been so much fun. He thought about that and thought about his son and if he would ever remember back on him as he remembered his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.


Because I am your child I believe in you. I am from you. I am you. With your eyes I gaze upon you. With your ears I listen to you. Do not abandon me in the wilderness. Do not abandon me in my days of need. Return to me. In the wilderness I will wait for you.
