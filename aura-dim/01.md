"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "But we've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

CHAPTER ONE
The Notebook

Not one minute before 2:15 in the morning the beams of a beat-to-hell Dodge Dart lit up the alleyway behind the abandoned strip mall where the Kroger used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. They were tweakers, but punctual tweakers, and so he liked them alright. Grady and Jenn. Maybe like was too strong a word. At least he hadn't ignored their desperate text to 'hook it up?' at this hour like he would most of his others. Tonight they had also asked if they could 'double dip' so they must have come into some cash since last Tuesday. That was no problem for him, and he texted back a simple '$$' before setting the time and place. Yet as soon as he saw their Dart inch past the garbage bins at the corner he got a bad feeling inside, like something deep in his gut, and nearly drove off before they spotted him. Instead he reached under his seat and pulled out the small pistol he kept there and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. Then he flashed his beams three times, very slow. They answered his flashes and then switched off their lights and drove to the corner where he was parked.
  She got out first, the kindly look in her eyes giving it away.
  "Sup, babydoll."
  "Jenn."
  Then to Grady, who was taking his sweet time with something.
  "It's cold out here, man. Let's do this thing."
  "That you gave us last time was straight," she interrupted with a gap-toothed grin, her voice uncouth, harsher than a female voice should be at her age. At one time she had been attractive.
  "Yeah?"
  "Mmmhmmm".
  "Good," he said, "Not like you guys twice in one week."
  Grady joined his girl and put his arm around the small of her back. He had some bundle tucked under his arm, wrapped up in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "Tell him babe."
  Grady gave a look like he was going to hit her.
  "I'm gonna tell him. Shut the fuck up, Jean. This ain't no fucking game."
  He palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "I said what's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, Will, it's cool. Chill out man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill out man. Just tell me what's in that bag. Right. Fucking. Now."
  He looked at them and watched as they became panic-eyed. Grady lifted his hands in a gesture to calm him down.
  "Dude, it's just a notebook. A notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Jenn said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
	"Don't blame me," she said, cupping her hand over a cigarette dangling from her mouth to light it.
	He wrapped his finger on the trigger inside the pocket and regarded the both of them. The sores around their mouths and eyes, the bitten nails, the malnourished bodies and greasy hair.   A sorry sight. Yet all he felt in the moment was an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with them, out in the cold in the night in a place like this.
	"A notebook?"
	"Show him," she said.
	Grady watched him, his eyes asking if it was okay.
	He nodded.
	Grady set the wrapped package onto the hood of his car and peeled the bag off. All the time he kept his eyes on him and more importantly on the hand in the jacket pocket. Grady was not naive, just strung out. In a moment he had the wrapping off and held it out.
	"A computer?"
	"Yeah, a notebook. Notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
	"Laptop, hon."
	"Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," Grady said, "It's a really nice computer we got ahold of. Apple brand. See?"
	He noticed the logo on the lid of the machine.
	"This thing, you could sell on Craigslist for a grand. A grand easy. We looked it up."
	"But we were thinking," Jenn stepped in, her voice softening, taking on a persuasive tone, "to save time, what if you let us give it to you, in exchange for a double? Then you could make a ton off just this one deal. All you have to do is sell it. Just this one time."
	"It works, we tried it out. We can show you how it works."
	The photograph came into focus and he could see what was happening here. The tension and unease he felt relaxed. His finger on the gun in his pocket relaxed. There was no conspiracy here, no LEO on a sting, or thugs around the corner waiting to pounce. Just fiends trying to pawn some loot on their man.
	"Turn it on."
	Grady lit up.
	"Sure thing, dude. Let me show you the screen on this bad boy. It looks sharp. This is top of the line right here. They don't make em any better than this."
	The computer was nice, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches. The keys all seemed to work. When Grady turned it on it went to a lock screen, with a single user account, the name Z.Jackson, the avatar a picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to notice. No matter about the account, there were ways around that.
	He stood back and considered the proposal. Honestly there wasn't much to consider. This was a solid machine. He had no doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. These fiends also knew how much it was worth, it was just that the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix, simply, and only tonight would do. So the standing back was a posture to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting the offer. To have that to hold over them in the future.
	"So whatcha think?" Jenn finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. Grady nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widened in her direction. But he said nothing, just waited.
	The man looked at them both and ran his hand along the outside of the notebook and closed the lid. He picked it up and weighed it in hand.
	
	Inside he set the computer on the little desk, then went to the kitchenette with the pint of rye whiskey and a sackful of Krystals. He poured two fingers into a used glass from the sink, added an ice cube, then lay back on the bed with the drink and the burgers, absently flipping through stations on the basic cable that came with the room. Afterwards, his gut was stuffed and his head was already swimming. He knew in the morning he would regret the bad food and possibly the drink, but as of now he hadn't had too much. He went to the kitchenette and poured another, smaller drink, and paced the floor of his room.
	His mind was full of the alcohol and Krystals and he felt like going for a walk. He felt like walking would clear out his head, just getting out of this place would, but he didn't go out. He stayed in and thought about Grady and Jenn. Someday soon he would be out of this selling to the junkies business and up and up, not having to deal with the day to day anymore. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control over his own life, might move out of this shithole and get a real place again, a regular place. Get another dog. He thought about what Grady and Jean were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the meth, there on the couch in their piece of shit trailer out in Kingston. He thought about how they had once been in love and even made love while taking it.
	Soon his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and threw up in the toilet, the chunks of undigested Krystal meat and onions in the bowl making him wretch even more. This place and the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He blamed it on that. Soon he would have his own place again and no smoking there. No sickening smoke smell to make you wretch in your more drunken moments. He got up and brushed his teeth and washed his face. He looked at himself in the mirror.
	"What's she see in that loser?" He said aloud, thinking of Jenn, the lack of any other female in his world placing her on some pedestal in his present psyche. He remembered her wonderful curves, before the meth, before she became the strung-out skeleton he saw tonight.
	He went to the kitchenette and poured another.
