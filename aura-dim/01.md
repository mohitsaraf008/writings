"At any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "But we've had enough of following our whims. It's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy. Remember my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

CHAPTER ONE
The Notebook

  Not a minute before two in the morning the headlight beams of an old Dodge spread up the walls of the alley behind the abandoned Huffaker Crossing strip mall, where the Kroger used to be, where he liked to meet up with folks this side of town. They were tweakers these two, but punctual tweaks, so he liked them okay. Well maybe like was too strong a word, but he hadn't ignored their text to 'hook it up?' like he would most others this late on a weeknight. But part of that was he had gone to high school with the girl back in the day. That was the thing about still living in the place where you grew up. Even more than most folks you get to see exactly how things go to hell.
  The text had also asked if they could do double, so they must have come into some cash since last Tuesday. That was no problem for him so he texted back a simple '$$' before setting the time and place. That was two hours ago. But as soon as he saw their car emerge from the garbage bins at the corner, he got a bad feeling inside, something deep in his gut, and nearly drove off. But he didn't. Instead he reached under his seat and pulled out the small pistol he kept there and stuffed it into his jacket pocket. Then he flashed his headlights three times. The car stopped, then continued. Its lights went dark as it pulled into the corner where he was parked.
  The girl he knew got out first, tight jeans, exposed midriff with stretchmarks, the kindly look in her eyes giving her game away. Something was up.
  "Sup, babydoll, how you been doin?"
  "Jenn."
  Then to him, who was taking his sweet time with something in the car.
  "It's cold out here, man. Let's do this thing."
  "Damn, that you gave us last time was straight, dude," she interrupted with a crooked-toothed grin, the sound of her voice uncouth, harsher than a female voice should be at her age.
  "Yeah?"
  "Mmmhmmm, oh yeah."
  The boyfriend joined her and put his arm around her thin waist. He had some kind of bundle tucked under his arm, wrapped in a garbage bag. The two of them exchanged a glance so subtle it would have gone unnoticed any other night.
  "What's in the bag?"
  "Tell him babe."
  He gave a look like he was going to hit her.
  "Jenn, babe, I got this."
  The man palmed the gun in his pocket.
  "I said, what's in the bag?"
  "It's cool, James, it's cool. Chill out man."
  "Don't tell me it's cool. Don't tell me to chill out. Just tell me what's in that bag. Now."
  The other man glanced at his hand in the jacket pocket. He grew panic-eyed and then lifted both hands to calm the situation.
  "James, dude, it's just a notebook. A notebook. That's all it is. Man I knowed I should of just told you on the text. Jenn said you wouldn't hear us out if I brung it up over the phone."
  "Don't blame me," she said, cupping her hand over a cigarette to light it.
  The sores around their mouths and eyes, the bitten nails, the malnourished bodies and greasy hair. A sorry sight. Yet all he felt was an agitation at having to deal with this bullshit, with them, out in the cold, out in the night in this place.
  "A notebook?"
  "Show him, Grady" she said.
  The boyfriend watched him, his eyes asking permission.
  He nodded.
  He set the package onto the hood of his car and unwrapped the bag. All the time he kept his eyes on the hand in the jacket pocket. He was not naive, just strung out. In a moment he had the bag off and held it out to him.
  "A computer?"
  "A notebook computer. Ain't that what they call them?"
  "Laptop, hon."
  "Whatever. Laptop. Notebook," he said, "It's a real nice model. No scratches or dings. Used though."
  The man regarded the computer but said nothing.
  "This thing, you could sell on Craigslist for a grand. A grand easy. We looked it up."
  "But then we got to thinking," she stepped in, her voice softening, "to save time, what if you just let us give it to you, in exchange for double what we normally do? Then you could make a ton off just this one deal. Just this one time, from now on we have cash."
  The boyfriend broke in.
  "It works, we tried it out. We can show you, its got battery left. No cord. But you can get one at the Wal-Mart."
  Things came into focus and the man understood. His finger released the trigger. There was no conspiracy here, no LEO on a sting, no thugs around the corner. Just some fiends desperate to pawn some loot for a fix.
  "Turn it on," he said.
  The boyfriend smiled.
  "Sure thing, James. Let me show you how bright the screen be on this bad boy. It look sharp. This is top of the line right here. They don't make em any better than this."
  The computer was nice, the smooth aluminum body in good shape, no dings or scratches. The keys all seemed to work. When Grady turned it on it went to a lock screen, with a single user account, the avatar a picture of a DNA strand, which he pretended not to see. That was not his concern.
  He stood back and considered their proposal, but there wasn't much to consider. This was a solid machine. He had no doubt he could have it sold by tomorrow, especially if he advertised on the Atlanta board. These tweakers also knew how much it was worth, it was just that the disease had them in such a thrall that it didn't matter. They needed that fix, and only tonight would do. So the standing back was posturing on his part to make it seem like he was doing them a favor by accepting their offer, to have that to hold over them.
  "Whatcha think?" The girl finally said, after nearly a minute of silence. Her boyfriend nearly came out of his skin, his eyes widened in her direction. But he said nothing, just waited.
  The man looked at them both and ran his hand along the outside of the notebook and closed the lid. He picked it up and weighed it in hand.
	
  Inside he set the computer on the little desk and then went to the kitchenette with the pint of rye whiskey and a sackful of Krystals. He poured two fingers into a used glass from the sink, added an ice cube, and then lay back on the bed with the drink and the burgers, absently flipping through stations on the basic cable that came with the room. Afterwards, his gut was stuffed and his head was already swimming. He knew in the morning he would regret the bad food and possibly the drink, but as of now he hadn't had too much. He went to the kitchenette and poured another, smaller drink, and paced the floor of his room.
  His mind was full of the alcohol and Krystals and he felt like going for a walk. He felt like walking would clear out his head, just getting out of this place would, but he didn't go out. He stayed in and thought about the tweakers. Someday soon he would be out of this selling to the junkies business and up and up, not having to deal with the day to day anymore. Then he might be able to regain some kind of control over his own life, might move out of this shithole and get a real place again, a regular place. Get another dog. He thought about what Grady and Jean were doing in this moment, their minds obliterated on the meth, there on the couch in their piece of shit trailer out in Kingston. He thought about how they had once been in love and even made love while taking it.
  Soon his stomach turned and he ran into the bathroom and threw up in the toilet, the chunks of undigested Krystal meat and onions in the bowl making him wretch even more. This place and the cigarette smoke. Always the stale smell of it. He blamed it on that. Soon he would have his own place again and no smoking there. No sickening smoke smell to make you wretch in your more drunken moments. He got up and brushed his teeth and washed his face. He looked at himself in the mirror.
  "What's she see in that loser?" He said aloud, thinking of the girl, the lack of any other female in his world placing her on some pedestal in his psyche. He remembered her wonderful curves, before the meth, before she became that strung-out skeleton.
  He went to the kitchenette and poured another.
