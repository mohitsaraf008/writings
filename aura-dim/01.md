AURA DIM

"They can't make decent bread anywhere; in winter they are frozen like mice in a cellar", 
she said; "here, at any rate, I've had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow," she added, 
pointing to Myshkin, who did not even recognize her. "We've had enough of following 
our whims; it's time to be reasonable. And all this, all this life abroad, and this 
Europe of yours is all a fantasy, and all of us abroad are only a fantasy...remember 
my words, you'll see it for yourself!" she concluded almost wrathfully, as she parted 
from Yevgeny Pavlovich.

"There's nothing left alive,
 but a pair of glassy eyes. 
 Raise my feelings one more time."

The Notebook

After returning from the deal with the laptop he looks out the window because 
the mexican who works the night shift at the office is beating on the door of the 
family across the way, the pimp next door is yelling at his girl, the pool with 
the brown tarp peeled back over dark green water, reminds him of a Florida vacation he 
took with his dad and brother and sister when they were just kids. They wore orange 
floatation balloons on their arms in the blue water of the pool and the sky was very blue against the 
white clouds. How clearly he could still recall it and even smell it and hear it and then he felt an 
emptiness within him at how far he was from those happy days and how fun that had all been and how his 
life would never again be so much fun. Then he thought of his own son whom he had not seen since last 
October and what he was doing right now and if he would ever think back on him as he thought back
his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

I can't help you.
