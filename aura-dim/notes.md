A story about a man who buys a laptop off craigslist. A scientist has committed suicide, working on a prototype that was meant to change the world, his house robbed and lab burned to the ground. The man discovers its the laptop of the man who committed suicide.

He didn’t commit suicide. It was murder. He’s not really dead, destroyed the technology, the world isn’t ready for it. The man inadvertently releases into the world, where it falls into the wrong hands, despite the scientists best wishes.

The stream can work at different magnitudes. You can learn information, history, thoughts, dreams, ambitions. He uses it as a mind-reader and learns the man next door is a pimp, trafficking underage girls.

Empathy > Telepathy > Mind-Reading

Sells edibles from Colorado. He lives in a non-descript town in North Georgia.

But the real application is telepathy, two way communication, and deeper than that, true empathy.

The technology works with media, images, video, sound, physical specimen

Neanderthals who discovered fire did not understand the physics or the chemistry behind 
combustion, but that didn't prevent them from using it for the benefit of everyone.

Down on his luck, used to work the extruder at the carpet mill until it shut down. No more work, town like the molt of a cicada, retaining the shape but dead, brittle, hollow. Now I got this deal where this guy I know trucks edibles from Colorado every few weeks. They are harder to detect by drug dogs. I sell those on forums.

I used to think about what else I could do, but I don't feel any heart anymore, any excitement.

The scientist has gone mad? Holy fool. Absolute empathy.

The man in the dark.
Dim the lights. Dim them.
