'The neanderthals who discovered fire did not understand the chemistry behind 
combustion, but importantly that didn't prevent them from harnessing it for the 
benefit of humanity.'

- quote from something

He sees this before knowing what is going on, what the device is

The device can only go one-way. She has figured out how to make it work two-ways. Breakthrough.

Symptoms and Signs of a Meth Addict

During methamphetamine use, a person's pupils become dilated, their heart rate increases and they may show signs of physical exertion (such as sweatiness and elevated body temperature). They may seem particularly agitated, nervous or frustrated. Because it is a strong stimulant, users will often go for long periods - possibly even days at a time - without sleep and a diminished appetite. Looking gaunt, drawn or undernourished is frequently a cause for concern even if it isn't indicative of a drug addiction, but when coupled with other symptoms of meth abuse these signs should be taken very seriously. Over long periods of addiction, the harsh chemicals in the drug cause oral deterioration, often termed "meth mouth", and skin health also suffers as increased acne and sores from skin-picking begin to appear.

SHORT TERM EFFECTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
Increased heart rate and blood pressureIrregular heartbeat and cardiovascular problemsInsomniaIntense irritabilityAnxiety/ParanoiaConvulsionsPossibility of stroke

LONG TERM EFFECTS INCLUDE:
DelusionsAuditory hallucinationsViolent behaviorHomicidal or suicidal thoughts

A story about a man who buys a laptop off craigslist. A scientist has committed suicide, working on a prototype that was meant to change the world, his house robbed and lab burned to the ground. The man discovers its the laptop of the man who committed suicide.

He didn’t commit suicide. It was murder. He’s not really dead, destroyed the technology, the world isn’t ready for it. The man inadvertently releases into the world, where it falls into the wrong hands, despite the scientists best wishes.

The stream can work at different magnitudes. You can learn information, history, thoughts, dreams, ambitions. He uses it as a mind-reader and learns the man next door is a pimp, trafficking underage girls.

Empathy > Telepathy > Mind-Reading

Sells edibles from Colorado. He lives in a non-descript town in North Georgia.

But the real application is telepathy, two way communication, and deeper than that, true empathy.

The technology works with media, images, video, sound, physical specimen

Neanderthals who discovered fire did not understand the physics or the chemistry behind 
combustion, but that didn't prevent them from using it for the benefit of everyone.

The Aura Stream

President Trump

Down on his luck, used to work the extruder at the carpet mill until it shut down. No more work, town like the molt of a cicada, retaining the shape but dead, brittle, hollow. Now I got this deal where this guy I know trucks edibles from Colorado every few weeks. They are harder to detect by drug dogs. I sell those on forums.

I used to think about what else I could do, but I don't feel any heart anymore, any excitement.

The scientist has gone mad? Holy fool. Absolute empathy.

The woman in the dark.
Make it dim. Make it dim.

The story ends with the main character emerging from somewhere, the government 
people are there, shadowy people, call out to him.

"Here I am."

Part One leads up to unlocking the encrypted drive to better understand the device. Turn, device is not just for mind reading, but for telepathy.

Part Two is story of the creation of the Aura algorithm and what led up to the fire. Turn, she is not really dead. Rant on money, feeling alone when friends abandon dreams.

Part Three, search for her, evade government agents, and company men. Turn, she is mad.

He needs to progress through three stages, maybe ending with empathy.

Drug buyers were hired to rough her up, steal equipment, government? corp?

Ends in vision of empathy

The man is bad in his heart. The woman is good in her heart. The discovery brings out 
what is in them. He becomes worse. She becomes better. We never know who the authority 
figures are, whether they represent the corporation or the government. At the end, 
he joins them, or rather it is left as an unknown, "Here I am."



Man: Fell on hard times -> Corrupt
Woman: Cold, analytic -> Empathetic


This is not science, this is pseudoscience at best. Snake Oil.
But it works.


Still got that lappy for sale?
Yeah I got it.
Take five hundred?
Its worth more than that.
How much you take?
Eight hundred, like it says in the ad.
Oh, alright then.

After returning from the deal with the laptop he looks out the window because 
the mexican who works the night shift at the office is beating on the door of the 
family across the way, the pimp next door is yelling at his girl, the pool with 
the brown tarp peeled back over dark green water, reminds him of a Florida vacation he 
took with his dad and brother and sister when they were just kids. They wore orange 
floatation balloons on their arms in the blue water of the pool and the sky was very blue against the 
white clouds. It was funny how clearly he could still recall it and even smell it and 
he then felt a deep sadness at how far he was now from those days and 
how fun it all was and how life would never again be so fun. He thought about that. 
Then he thought of his own son and what he was doing right now and if he would ever think about 
him as he remembered his own father and that was the last thing he thought before sleep took him.

I can't help you.

  Sees the news
  Gets into the computer, discovers p.aura, follows instructions, tries it out on some neighbors, keyword M-O-N-E-Y.
  Goes to find Grady and Jenn, cops swarming their place. Drives out to Lake Weiss to a camper. They are dead, apparent overdose, but its a setup. He wonder if they'll track him down.
  Back at the hotel his stuff has been ransacked. He waits until that night and decides to rob the guy with ten grand when he goes out. When he breaks in, using a hidden key, he finds it trashed out, a young Mexican girl is handcuffed in the small bathtub. She is naked, won't look at him. "Help." He doesn't help her.
In a Car Crash, man injured, bleeding out, dying. He could help; but doesn't. He leaves the scene.

Unfortunately it doesn't work that way, James. You are not in a position to ask questions of us. You are not in control here. This will be hard for you to accept but it is the truth, and you will understand that truth in time. Further, you are not in control of your own life. You never have been. You never will be. Do you know the most influential force in the world? Inertia. People do not want freedom. They want comfort. To be taken care of. A life of ease and entertainment, of rich food and parties. To be soothed and pampered from the time they are born until their bodies are lowered into the ground.

That ain't true. I love. I have loved. My boy. I love him more than my own life. I know that.

Dogs love their own James. Do you think of yourself angelic because of that? It is instinct. He loves you because you provide for him, give him that comfort we are speaking about. And you love him because of chemicals in your nervous system, millions of years of genetic programming to keep our species propagating. That's all.
That's not true.
We are afraid so.

As you judged others we judged you. We forgive you.

Yells at someone for no reason except agitation.

In light of recent events I feel like I need to address something. There has been an unspoken presumption among us that I need to address at this time, especially now. The presumption is this - that only work which can make us money or has potential to make money in the future is worthy our time and attention. I reject that presumption. From the core of my being I reject it. And though I have no evidence for it, a part of me knows in fact the opposite is really the truth.

People want to sleepwalk through life, people want to get fat. Once you had access to the device what did you do? You might have done anything, you looted a pimp, a restaurant owner, a lawyer. Think about that won't you.

Leaves gifts for son. Is confronted by mother, calls him a piece of shit, gives the gifts back.

He learns the device is not for reading minds, it's for communication. Zoey opens a stream and they join. This is where he learns her story, the dream of Donald Trump, and where she is in hiding.

He leads her to them. They had been monitoring him all along.
We judged you as you judged others. Why didn't you help the girl in the hotel room? Why didn't you stop to help the people in the car accident?
You were supposed to kill our man. You were supposed to discover the keycard. As we suspected you felt nothing.
Talks through intercom.
She did this to herself. No clothes, no food or water.
Talks in the voice of his son, forgiveness. Return to me, father return. Forgive others as I have forgiven you. This is my prayer.

DT in the back of a Maybach, listening to the original version of China Girl. Awash with feelings of feminine ecstacy, vulnerable, yielding.

DT slithering on his stomach like an obese serpant, his red tie scraping on the dirt, his head upturned, his beady eyes looking.

teener, ball, geeked up
Needs a scene where he exploits a woman's fantasy for his own pleasure.
He wakes up from a dream reunited with carol and walker, in his loneliness he finds an unhappy woman who has fantasies of an unrequited love, he uses those fantasies to seduce her - a scene at Christmas, floating on a moving sea of wrapping paper, she loses him momentarily.
She routinely has affairs, trying to recapture that feeling of a perfect love.
They have sex, each thinking of others they want to be with.
Truth is losing. Losing out to fantasy and delusional belief systems.



You used to be someone who didn't care about money. Remember those conversations we had, late in the lab, of doing great work, helping others, Jonas Salk, you know?
The world isn't as black and white as we thought when we were undergrads.
We help people. You can't say we don't help others doing what we do. And I make enough money 
now to help my parents now. How is that not a good thing? Its only a good thing.
Something is different. Something slipped in along with all those good intentions. Something cynical and ugly.
I feel like everyone who used to be on my side has abandoned me, one by one, and I'm alone.
It's called growing up.
The world is much bigger than we knew back then. We were just kids.
I feel alone.
Elementary school, one boy started and whoever he tagged had to hold his hand so they 
formed a human chain, and the chain reached out and tagged others and slowly the chain grew, link by link, and 
before long it was this long swaying thing, undulating with the kids faces laughing, and soon only she was left. 
But it was coming for her too. And it did.

Impatience, agitation with others. Blaming others for his problems.

They encourage you with their words but their eyes are uninterested. But as soon as you talk of money, of the prospect 
of making a profit, their eyes light up, their voices jump an octave. Then you see what moves them, truly. You see then what stirs their souls.

Sick boy pulling a barrel full of trash. He is sick so having a hard time. He has a snake growing out of his forehead, it curls around his head and neck, very slowly it slithers out, as it comes it covers more and more of his face.

A scene where they meet in a luxurious shopping center. He feels unclean. Is greeted with some insincere corporate speak.

Welcome to Avalon, we're having a wonderful day, let us know how we can bring some joy to your life!

Fuck you.
