The Notebook

This right here, right now, ain't no place I want to be. Not this time of night. One in the morning. Sitting in my old rusty old Daytona behind that half-abandoned strip mall on the west side of town, Big Lots, some furniture outlet that’s been going out of business for two years, the remains of the old Mexican place where I got food poisoning in seventh grade, a Radio Shack closing down at the end of the year. Grass coming up through cracks in the faded asphault. And that’s the good side.

This is how it works...

The din of their voices, the din, din, din!
