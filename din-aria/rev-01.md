The Notebook

Shit. This ain't nowhere I want to be. Not at one in the morning. I'm behind that old, half-abandoned strip mall on the west side of town, Big Lots, some furniture outlet that’s been going out of business for two years, the remains of the old Mexican place where I got food poisoning in seventh grade, a Radio Shack closing down at the end of the year. Grass coming up through cracks in the faded asphault. And that’s the good side.
