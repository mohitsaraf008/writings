FETUS
Daniel Stepp

You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes. You are walking through a forest, or a place that gives you the impression of a forest, though there are no trees, no grass, nor any leaves on the ground. Nothing you would normally associate with a forest is to be seen and yet you are reminded of one. From the corner of your eyes you can see shapes, organic perhaps, arranging themselves into familiar objects, and yet whenever you look closer they immediately scurry out of your periphery like cockroaches. You cannot remember when you began the journey that brought you to this forest, nor where you left from. You do have a memory, appearing like an iridescent fog in your mind, of a time when all that was good in life was no longer good and how over time the bad took its place in your heart, so that eventually the memory of goodness had been lost to you. As strange as this wood is, and how disoriented you are, there are some clues that connect you back to your former self and you focus your mind intently on them. For example, you know there is such a thing as a forest and that this place is not one though it seems to want you to think it is. You also know it is a bit odd to think of a landscape as having intentions towards you, benevolent or not. Yet this is where you find yourself.

Ahead is a hillside. From up there you may be able to get your bearings and figure out where to go next.

Behind you is the shapeless forest, vanishing into an impenetrable darkness. Maybe you should go back.
