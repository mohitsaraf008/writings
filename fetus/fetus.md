FETUS
Daniel Stepp

You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes. You walk through the woods, or a place that gives you the impression of woods, though there are no trees here, no grass, nor any leaves on the ground. There are shapes and structures (organic?) which arrange themselves into things familiar from the corner of your eye but whenever you focus on them they vanish out of your periphery. You cannot remember how you begn the journey that brought you here. You cannot remember the place you left from. You cannot even remember your own name. Yet there are clues that connect you back to your former self and you set your mind to not forget them too. For example you know there is such a thing as woods and that this place is not one, though it seems to want you to think it is. You also know it was a bit off to think of a landscape as having intentions, good or bad, towards you. Yet this is the place you find yourself.

Ahead you see a hill. Maybe from up there you can get your bearings and figure out where to go from here.

Behind you are the woods, vanishing into the darkness of the night. What if you turned back?
