The man walked through the woods, or a place that gave him the impression of woods, though there were no trees, no grass, nor even any dry leaves on the ground. There were shapes and structures (organic?) that arranged themselves into things familiar from the corner of his eye but whenever he focused on them they scurried immediately out of his periphery. The man could not remember how he had begun the journey that had brought him here. He could not remember the place he left from. He could not remember his name. Yet there were clues that connected him back to his former self and he set his mind to not forget them too. For example he knew there was such a thing as woods and that this place was not one, though it seemed to want him to think it was. He also knew it was a bit insane to think a landscape as having intentions, good or bad. Yet this was the place he found himself.

Ahead he saw a hill. Maybe from up there he could get his bearings and figure out where to go from here.

Behind him was more woods, vanishing into the dark of the night. What if he turned back?
