The man walked through the woods, or a place that gave him the impression of woods, though there were no trees, no grass, not even any dry leaves on the ground. There were shapes and organic structures that arranged themselves into things that looked familiar out of the corner of his eye but whenever he focused on them they shifted out of his periphery. The man had no memory of his name. He could not remember how he had begun the journey that had brought him here. He could not remember the place he left. Yet there were clues that connected him back to his former self. For example he knew there was such a thing as woods and that here was not one, though it seemed to want him to think it was. He also knew it was a bit insane to think a landscape as having intentions towards him. Yet this was the place he found himself.

Ahead he saw a hill. Maybe from up there he could get his bearings and figure out where to go from here.

Behind him was more woods, vanishing into the dark of the night. What if he turned back?
