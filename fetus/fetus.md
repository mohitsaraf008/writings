FETUS
Daniel Stepp

You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes. You are walking through a forest or a place that gives you the impression of a forest, though there are no trees, no grass, nor any leaves on the ground. There are shapes, organic perhaps, arranging themselves into familiar objects you can see from the corner of your eyes, and yet whenever you look closer they scurry out of your periphery, like cockroaches in a basement. You cannot remember when you began the journey that brought you here, nor where you left from. You can recall there had been a time when all that had been good in your life no longer seemed good to you and how over time the bad took its place in your heart, so even the memory of goodness had been lost to you in the end. Strange as this forest is, and how disoriented you are, there are some clues that connect you back to your former self and you focus your mind intently on them. For example, you know there is such a thing as a forest and that this place is not one though it seems to want you to think it is. You also know it was a bit odd to think of a landscape as having intentions towards you, benevolent or not. Yet this is the place you find yourself.

Ahead is a hillside. From up there you may be able to get your bearings and figure out where to go next.

Behind you is the shapeless forest, vanishing into an abyss of darkness. Maybe you should go back.
