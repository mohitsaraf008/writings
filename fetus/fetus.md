FETUS
Daniel Stepp

You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes. You walk through a wood or a place that gives you the impression of a forest, though there are no trees, no grass, nor any leaves on the ground. There are shapes, organic perhaps, arranging themselves into familiar objects you can see from the corner of your eyes, and yet whenever you look closer they scurry out of your periphery, like cockroaches in a basement. You cannot remember when you began the journey that brought you here, nor where you left from. Nor your own name. You can recall a time when all that was good in your life no longer seemed good and how over time the bad had taken its place in your heart so that even the feeling of goodness had been lost to you. As strange as this forest is, and how disoriented you are, there are some clues that connect you back to your former self and you set your mind intently not to lose them. For example, you know there is such a thing as a forest and that this place is not one though it seems to want you to think it is. You also know it was a bit daft to think of a landscape as having intentions towards you, benevolent or not. Yet this is where you find yourself.

Ahead is a hillside. From the top maybe you can get your bearings and figure out where to go next.

Behind you is the shapeless forest, vanishing into an abyss of shadows. Maybe you should go back.
