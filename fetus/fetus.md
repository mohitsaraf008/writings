FETUS
Daniel Stepp

You are used to the darkness by now, finding your way in the darkness, without the use of your eyes. You walk through a wood, or a place that gives you the impression of a forest, though there are no trees, no grass, nor any leaves on the ground so you are not even sure why it makes you think of one, though it does. There are shapes, possibly organic, arranging themselves into familiar structures you can see from the corners of your eyes yet whenever you look closer they seem to scurry out of your periphery, like cockroaches. You cannot remember when you began the journey that brought you here, nor where you left from. Nor your own name. Vaguely you recall how there was a time when all that was good in life was no longer good to you and how the bad, slowly and imperceptibly, had taken the place of it in your heart, and how in the end even goodness had been lost to you. Strange as this place is there are clues that connect you back to your former self and you set your mind intently not to forget them too. For example, you know there is such a thing as a forest and that this place is not one though it seems to want you to think it is. You also know it was a bit odd to think of a landscape as having intentions towards you, good or bad. Yet this is where you find yourself.

Ahead is a hillside. From the top maybe you can get your bearings and figure out where to go next.

Behind you is the shapeless forest, vanishing into an abyss of shadows. Maybe you should go back.
