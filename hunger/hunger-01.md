HUNGER

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver who had roused him from his slumber only moments before. Though it was springtime the night air was sharply cold and because she had given him no time to dress all he had on was his loincloth, leggings, and mocassins. Bare from the waist up he wrapped both arms around him and tucked his hands into his armpits for warmth. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they walked down the torchlit pathway he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. A fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills and obscured the small houses on either side of the path where they walked. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her hair where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like two snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. The boy entered alone.
  Yaholo, a pupil of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the house. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand the pupil carried an eagle’s claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he spoke the words of the death ritual in a rhythmic chant. His eyes gazed upon a faraway place.
  Ama, his mother, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her breast, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
	Sakima, the revered medicine man of their village, lay upon a meager bed, wrapped in blankets and covered in sweat. He lay utterly still except for the gasps for air that came after long and irregular intervals. His eyes were rolled back in his head and there was a wet cloth draped over his forehead.
	No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took the hand of his father into his own.
	“Father,” the boy said, kneeling next to the bed, and tears welling in his eyes, “I love you.”
   He sat there in silence, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his father’s mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet his lips he came around again. His eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. Tears ran down the side of his cheeks and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own and squeezed weakly.
	“Beautiful boy,” the old man said, “Come and see.”
	The son leaned forward and placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the bitter salve, medicine applied to ease his suffering. He felt his heart beating, fast then slow, strong then weak. At last he felt the body heat, the life which remained in the body of his father. The boy stayed in this position for some time. They did not speak. His father only wanted to feel his son close to him.
	Then to his surprise, underneath the table along the wall, the boy saw a brown chicken pecking for seeds in the corner, oblivious to all else in the room. Concerned only with its own mindless existence. Pecking and eating while his father lay on the bed dying. The boy watched it for some time and became more and more angry at it being there. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
	But then his father spoke into his ear and everything he could see with his eyes instantly dimmed and everything he could hear with his ears, except for the words, instantly became silent. Then there were only the words and the sick, foul breath in his ear. His father asked something of him, a secret will, of which he was not to tell another soul. And when there was nothing more to say the sick man collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again.
	The boy rose and stared at his father, unsure if he had understood, unsure of the reality of those words even. He glanced to his mother in the corner and recognized her pain. He went to console her.
	Yaholo approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton made from green soapstone from his medicine bag and waved it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched with interest. The old medicine man came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He was in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with uncommon strength.
	Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this sound his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard.
	Sakima was awake. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and shouted in anger at Yaholo, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his pupil’s eyes yet he continued to utter the chants of the ritual. Then he glanced at his son. His eyes were wild and fearful, and the boy did not recognize him from the loving father he had always known.
	“Do what I ask of you.”
	Then he collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later became silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
	He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside  into the fog, unsure of where he was going. He ran for minutes while groping ahead for something familiar to him. And finally he reached a place he recognized and stopped. 
	At the base of the tree which was planted in the middle of the ceremonial grounds. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It’s bark was petrified, smooth and stone-like. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. It was sacred to the village, it’s symbol in fact. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and had always asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” Sakima had replied with patience, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures who must have inhabited the earth when it lived and who had also perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
	Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and stars were in the sky. The moon was low and the morning was yet to come. The boy fell asleep against the trunk, shivering and goosebumped. But he did not dream. Later, after the old medicine man had passed from this world, his mother discovered him sleeping there and wrapped a blanket around him for warmth and to keep him dry from the morning dew.
