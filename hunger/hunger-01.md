HUNGER

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver who had roused him from his slumber only moments before. Though it was springtime the night air was sharply cold and because she had given him no time to dress all he had on was his loincloth, leggings, and mocassins. Bare from the waist up he wrapped both arms around him and tucked his hands into his armpits for warmth. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they walked down the torchlit pathway he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. A fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills and obscured the small houses on either side of the path where they walked. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her hair where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like two snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. The boy entered alone.
  Yaholo, an apprentice of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the house. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand the apprentice carried an eagle’s claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he chanted the words of the death ritual. His eyes gazed upon a faraway place.
  Ama, his mother, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her chest, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
  Sakima, the revered medicine man of their village, lay upon a meager bed, wrapped in skins. He lay utterly still except for the gasps for air that came after long and irregular intervals. His eyes were rolled back in his head and sweat covered him.
  No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took his hand into his own.
  “Father,” the boy said, kneeling beside him, tears welling in his eyes.
  He said nothing else, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his father’s mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet the lips he came around again. His eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. A tear rolled down the side of his cheek and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own, and squeezed weakly.
  “Beautiful boy,” the old man said, “Come and see.”
  The boy leaned forward and placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the bitter salve, medicine applied to ease his suffering. He felt his heart beating, rapid and then slow, strong and then weak. At last he could feel the body heat, the life which remained in the body of his father. The boy stayed that way for a long time. They did not speak. He knew his father only wanted to feel close to him.
  Then underneath the table along the wall the boy saw a brown chicken pecking for seeds in the corner, oblivious to all else in the room. Concerned only with its own mindless existence. Pecking in the dirt while his father lay dying. He watched it for awhile and grew angry at it being there. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
  Then his father whispered into his ear and everything he could see instantly dimmed and everything he could hear, except for the words, instantly grew silent. Sakima asked something of him, a deed he must perform. The act of speaking weakened him and afterwards he collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and stared at his father, unsure if he had understood what had been asked of him, unsure if it had really been meant for him.
	He glanced to his mother in the corner and saw her pain, biting her hands. He went to console her.
  Yaholo approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton made from green soapstone from his medicine bag and shook it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He appeared to be in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with uncommon strength.
  Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this sound his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard.
  Sakima was awake. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and shouted in anger at Yaholo, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his apprentice’s eyes yet he continued to utter the chants of the ritual. Then he glanced at his son. His eyes were wild and fearful, and the boy did not recognize him from the loving father he had always known.
  “Do what I ask of you.”
  Then he collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later became silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
  He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside  into the fog, unsure of where he was going. He ran for minutes while groping ahead for something familiar to him. And finally he reached a place he recognized and stopped. 
  At the base of the tree which was planted in the middle of the ceremonial grounds. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It’s bark was petrified, smooth and stone-like. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. It was sacred to the village. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” his father had replied with patience, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures which must have inhabited the earth when it lived and had perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
  Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and stars were visible in the sky. The moon was low. The morning was yet to come. He fell asleep against the trunk, shivering and goosefleshed, and he did not dream. Later, after his father had passed from this world, his mother covered him with a blanket and brushed back his hair and kissed his forehead gently.

  For seven days the village mourned. For seven days they fasted. Yet to him by far the worst of it was whenver he looked up at the skies. They were skies of the deepest blue and clouds of the purest white. How at odds to the thunderstorms he felt within. He hated all the beautiful things. He spent those days crying and beating on his chest until it was bruised. Together he sat with his mother and her sister Ayita outside their homestead. The women expressed their sorrow in an endless chant where they repeated the name “Sakima” until they ran out of breath. His nephews and cousins covered themselves in ashes and sliced their fingers with sharp pieces of flint. Other neighbors and those who had known, or just respected, the old medicine man wailed in their homes. All were forbidden to laugh or smile or even to speak a light word during this period.
  Then it was over and Yaholo came to their home. With him were two helpers, though they stayed outside. Ama greeted them and provided tea for them to drink. As the most experienced medicine man in the village Yaholo was now in charge of cleansing the home of the departed as part of the rites of purification. He removed all of Sakima’s belongings, the utensils of his trade, even the skins he slept on, and placed them in a wooden chest they had brought along for that purpose. Afterwards there was not much left in the house but material things were easily replaced, so Ama was not much concerned. All the runes and tools Sakima had kept in his medicine chest were taken as they could be used in future rituals. The book of legends and spells Yaholo already had in his possession, it being the most valuable thing a medicine man kept and public property.
  Outside the helpers carried off the box of belongings to the ceremonial grounds. Yaholo joined them as he was in charge of the ritual this evening and had to oversee the preparations.
  The boy went inside and looked out of the window. He saw people going back and forth, some his friends, carrying materials for building and baskets of food. His heart was low, as if it had no bottom. As the son of the departed he was exempt from participating in the work going on for the ritual, but he felt like it might do him good to put his body and mind to use in some way. So he went outside and headed to the ceremonial grounds with the others.
  A platform constructed from reeds was being raised in the center of the grounds, near the high mound upon which rested the council house, where the chief of peace resided. The boy set immediately to work lashing together the platform with strips of buckskin. If any of the others noticed him as the son of the departed they did not say so. They treated him like any other and that was the way he liked it. Doing the work made him forget his sadness. It took five of them to push the platform up on its legs. Later, the body of his father would be brought out and placed upon this bed and then hoisted on another base to lift the platform even higher. At last it would be six or seven feet off the ground.
  By now the sun was going down and shined through the treetops on the hillside to the west. The boy was covered with dirt and his arms and back ached from the labor. He watched the women set up tables near the platform and then dishes of all kinds were brought out and arranged upon them. Roasted deer meat, pork, rabbit and other game were at the center. Then surrounding those steaming dishes were bowls filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and his favorite, kanuchi soup, which is made from hickory nuts.
  Families from the surrounding valley were starting to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful clothes. He saw his own family arrive from the other side of the village, Ama and her sister Ayita and her two boys, her husband. When his mother saw him she looked disapprovingly at his soiled clothes and dirty face and spit on her hand to wipe him clean.
  “Go home and clean yourself. Put on fresh clothes. You disrespect your father!”
  By the time he returned it was twilight. The boy walked among the people on the grounds. He felt alone among them and tried to stay out of sight of his family who had a central place on a bench near the base of the tree, directly in view of the platform where the bonfire was to be lit. He found a hidden spot away from the crowds and sat on the ground to watch it all. His heart was low and he wanted to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the tree whose shadowed branches twisted up towards the muted skies. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. 
  Then he remembered the last words his father had spoken to him. Somehow he had not thought of them once since that night. But now they returned and he knew somehow he could never forget them. Maybe tonight he would share what he said to the people of the village. Maybe they would know what his father had meant by them. Or maybe not. Maybe the ghost of his father would visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant himself, and why it was so important that he do what had been asked of him. But he knew such things did not really happen. Only in stories did they happen.
