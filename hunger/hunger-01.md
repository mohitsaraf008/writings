HUNGER

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver who had roused him from his slumber only moments before. Though it was springtime the night air was sharply cold and because she had given him no time to dress all he had on was his loincloth, leggings, and mocassins. Bare from the waist up he wrapped both arms around him and tucked his hands into his armpits for warmth. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they walked down the torchlit pathway he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. A fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills and obscured the small houses on either side of the path where they walked. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her hair where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like two snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. The boy entered alone.
  Yaholo, an apprentice of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the house. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand the apprentice carried an eagle’s claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he chanted the words of the death ritual. His eyes gazed upon a faraway place.
  Ama, his mother, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her chest, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
  Sakima, the revered medicine man of their village, lay upon a meager bed, wrapped in skins. He lay utterly still except for the gasps for air that came after long and irregular intervals. His eyes were rolled back in his head and sweat covered him.
  No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took his hand into his own.
  “Father,” the boy said, kneeling beside him, tears welling in his eyes.
  He said nothing else, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his father’s mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet the lips he came around again. His eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. A tear rolled down the side of his cheek and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own, and squeezed weakly.
  “Beautiful boy,” the old man said, “come and see.”
  The boy leaned forward and placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the bitter salve, medicine applied to ease his suffering. He felt his heart beating, rapid and then slow, strong and then weak. At last he could feel the body heat, the life which remained in the body of his father. The boy stayed that way for a long time. They did not speak. He knew his father only wanted to feel close to him.
  Then underneath the table along the wall the boy saw a brown chicken pecking for seeds in the corner, oblivious to all else in the room. Concerned only with its own mindless existence. Pecking in the dirt while his father lay dying. He watched it for awhile and grew angry at it being there. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
  Then Sakima whispered into his ear and everything he could see instantly dimmed and everything he could hear, except for the words, instantly grew silent. His father asked something of his son, a secret will. And when finished, the old man collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and stared at his father, unsure if he had understood. It was all so strange. So like a dream. 
  He saw his mother in the corner, weepping into her hands. He went to console her. Yaholo approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton of soapstone from his medicine bag and shook it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He appeared to be in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with unnatural strength.
  Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this sound his father let out a scream unlike anything he had ever heard.
  Sakima was awake. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and shouted in anger at Yaholo, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his apprentice’s eyes yet he continued to utter the chants of the ritual. Then he glanced at his son. His eyes were wild and fearful and the boy did not recognize him from the loving memory he had of him.
  “Do what I ask of you.”
  Then he collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later became silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
  He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside  into the fog, unsure of where he was going. He ran for minutes while groping ahead for something familiar to him. And finally he reached a place he recognized and stopped. 
  At the base of the tree which was planted in the middle of the ceremonial grounds. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It’s bark was petrified, smooth and stone-like. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. It was sacred to the village. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” his father had replied with patience, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures which must have inhabited the earth when it lived and had perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
  Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and stars were visible in the sky. The moon was low. The morning was yet to come. He fell asleep against the trunk, shivering and goosefleshed, and he did not dream. Later, after his father had passed from this world, his mother covered him with a blanket and brushed back his hair and kissed his forehead gently.

  For seven days the village mourned. For seven days they fasted. The worst of it came each morning when went outside and gazed upwards. There were skies of the deepest blue and clouds of the purest white. The calm breeze. How at odds to the darkened vistas and thunderstorms he felt within. He hated every beautiful thing. He spent those days weeping and beating on his chest until it was bruised. Together he sat with his mother and her sister outside their homestead. The women expressed their sorrow in an endless chant where they repeated the name of the departed until they ran out of breath. His nephews and cousins covered themselves in ashes and sliced their fingertips with sharp pieces of flint. Other neighbors wailed in their homes. All were forbidden to laugh or smile or even to speak a light word during this period.
  When it was over the boy looked out of the window. He saw people going back and forth, some his friends, carrying materials for building and baskets of food. His heart was still low, as if it had no bottom. As the son of the departed he was not required to participate in the work going on for the funeral rites, but he felt like it might do him good to put his body and mind to use in some way. So he went outside and headed to the ceremonial grounds with the others.
  A platform constructed from reeds was being raised in the center of the grounds, near the trunk of the great tree and the high mound upon which rested the council house, where the chief resided. The boy set immediately to work lashing together the platform with strips of buckskin. If any of the others noticed him as the son of the departed they did not say so. They treated him like any other and that was the way he liked it.
  The remainder of the day he helped with the preparations. By now the sun was going down and shined through the treetops. The boy was covered with dirt and his arms and back ached from the labor of the day. He sat and watched the women set up tables near the platform and then dishes of all kinds were brought out and arranged upon them. Roasted deer meat, pork, rabbit and other game were at the center. Then surrounding those steaming dishes were bowls filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and his favorite, kanuchi soup, which is made from hickory nuts.
  Families from the surrounding valley were starting to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful clothes. He saw his own family arrive from the other side of the village, Ama and her sister Ayita with her husband and two boys. When his mother saw him she looked disapprovingly at his soiled clothes and dirty face and spit on her hand to wipe him clean.
  “Go prepare yourself.”
  By the time he returned it was evening. He walked among the crowds who were eating and drinking. The boy was not hungry himself. He remained out of sight of his family who had a central place on a bench near the base of the tree. He found a hidden spot away from the crowds and sat on the grass to watch from there. His heart was low and he wanted to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the tree whose shadowed branches spiraled towards the muted skies. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him.
  Then suddenly he remembered the last words his father had spoken to him. Strange he had not thought of them once since that night. Now they returned and somehow he knew that he would never forget them. Maybe tonight he ought to share them with the people of the village. That would be his contribution. Maybe they could understand their significance, and explain them.
  At last the elders emerged from the council house and descended into the ceremonial grounds. There were five of them total and they were dressed in magnificent garb. The most delicate deerskins covered in beads and feathers. Their faces were painted red and white. Kulsathee, the old chief of peace, led them with a solemn frown. When they reached the benches at the foot of the tree they turned to face the people gathered. But their gaze was fixed on the two men who approached the funeral platform with the body of the departed medicine man.
  When the boy saw the body of Sakima, who had been anointed with oils and covered in dark paint, then dressed in a ritual gown, nothing like what he normally wore, he wept. The bearers reached the platform and lifted the body onto it. Then a group of them together lifted the platform onto the tall legs, where it fit into slots. They brought all of his belongings out and laid them at the base of the platform. Wood was brought and arranged for the burning. Another young man carried the tinder close to the pyramid of kindling and fuel wood and used a block of flint to start the fire. It caught quickly and within minutes the entire platform was engulfed in flames, an bright orange glow cast onto the tearful faces of the people who had loved him most.
  So bright it burned that even the boy was no longer completely hidden in the shadows of the evening. He watched the flames consume the old medicine man. Plumes of dark smoke and flecks of embered ash rolled into the air above them. He turned to the crowd and there among them he saw a pair of eyes staring back at him. His friend Tye, who was a hunter like himself, and therefore trained to see things that wanted to remain out of sight. Tye was savvy. He would respect his wishes and not approach his friend in mourning. Instead he made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, this was a secret  symbol of their friendship. The boy returned the gesture from his spot in the darkness. His true friend.
  Yet someone else had discovered him there in the flickering light of the funeral pyre, approaching him from the side so as not to be detected. She emerged carrying food. The light from the funeral fire was reflected in her eyes and her long, braided hair shimmered, smooth and flowing like a dark river. Leoti was beautiful indeed. She placed a bowl of kanuchi on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. He gazed upon her and then at the bowl, steam rising from it in the cool air.
  “Eat, Mika.”
  “I am not hungry.”
  But he knew it was not a request, and that she would not leave him be until he ate, so he picked up the bowl and drank the soup down with only a few gulps. It was good, rich and sweet. Leoti then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. It was still warm and the grease seeped through the wrappings.
  “Eat.”
  He ate the bread and meat too and then invited her to sit next to him. She did so. He noticed she did not try to console him though he saw the pity in her eyes. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how truly hungry he was. They sat together while the fire burned. He was happy she was here. Now when he looked at the people gathered in the ceremonial grounds he saw them differently than before. He saw the love that had brought them together and that this love was not something to take for granted. He felt it himself and no longer wanted to be alone. He took Leoti by the hand and led them to the benches where his family sat. Ama received them with warmth and hugged them.
  As the evening went on people came by to pay respects. When it was very late and the fire had burned low the people who remained came closer and they each took turns telling stories about the old medicine man. Each story surprised the boy because it was like they were talking about someone other than his father. 
  At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the circle of elders. He was a large, rotund man with long graying hair. He was the chief of peace and had been the leader of their tribe ever since before the boy was born. There were deep lines in his face and whenever he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather. His eyes were red and cheeks were wet from many tears.
  “All the old things are gone now and the people are different.  When we were boys Sakima and I roamed these forests and hunted together. Even then he was drawn to the mysteries of nature. He would commune with the spirit of the trees to reveal where the rabbits were hidden. We caught so many! It is true I loved Sakima, whom you all knew, from the time we were both boys and had our whole lives in ahead of us. He was my good friend and I will miss him.”
  It was then, in the lull between speakers, that the boy felt compelled to speak. He rose and approached the center of the circle near the remnants of the bonfire whose embers still glowed and gave off heat. Nobody said anything when they saw him approach. Kulsathee walked up to him and held both of his arms in the gesture of great kinship and then returned to his seat with the elders.
  Moments passed. The boy looked into the crowd and saw their hopeful and expectant faces. He knew they wanted to hear something about the beloved medicine man, and his father. He saw their sadness and felt a longing within to heal what was broken in their hearts. But he said nothing. Only now was it clear that what had been asked of him was not for them to hear. It was a whisper after all. His responsibility was not to tell. Only to do. The boy was embarrassed he had nothing to say. The people stirred and grew impatient. Some in the crowd put it down to youthful shyness. Some took it as disrespect. Some pitied him. Some said he was not the man his father was.

  It was the season of abundance in the valley. The forests and meadows had turned green and blossomed with a myriad of wildflowers and berries. The river which ran close to the village, and irrigated their crops, glimmered the mild afternoon sunlight. Women went daily to its banks and pulled fish from traps that had been set just below the small cascades. These fish they roasted that same evening for dinner, there being no need to dry and salt them for storage. Men hunted game in the nearby woods, or did carpentry work that had been put off during the winter. They fixed leaky roofs and built summer shelters for the elders, which allowed the breeze to blow through. The younger children played hide and seek in the village and surrounding wilds. They went shirtless and ate blackberries until their fingers and mouths were stained purple. The older children gathered in the wide open space on the southern edge of the village grounds. Here a field had been cleared of all grass and shrubs so that only the dirt ground remained. The ground had been hardened by many years of footsteps and weather, so that it was nearly polished. Here they played dice and other ball games. Stick ball was popular but the game that required the most skill was tchungkee.
  This was a game for hunters since it required the use of a flat-tipped spear. A small, stone disc the size of a grapefruit was rolled into the center of a demarcated arena. The hunters stood at the edge and threw their spears where they thought the disc would end up, based on its often unpredictable path. Points were distributed by whose spear landed nearest the disc. Tchungkee was so popular that many elders, who were no longer required to farm or hunt during the day, set up ramadas on the edge of the field and smoked tobacco while placing bets on the games.
  For many seasons now the best player in the village was Mika. This was well known and there was even a rule put in place by the gamblers so one could not bet Mika more than four times in one day. And yet, ever since his the passing of Sakima, whose name was forbidden to be spoken aloud for one year, his game had fallen off considerably. He was no longer the sure bet he used to be, and both the elders and certain children were beginning to take advantage of it.
  Mohe, an athletic but not particularly bright boy, had challenged him to a game earlier that morning. Mika had not felt like playing today, but when he saw the expectant faces of the elders at the other end he rose from the sidelines, where he sat with Tye, and took up his spear.
  “I'll go easy on you today,” Mohe taunted him. He twirled his spear upright and deftly threw it at a practice target a little ways from them.
  Mika ignored him and ran his hands along the grain of his spear, then walked to the arena. The disc tosser got in position and gave the ready signal with a wave of his hand. Mika and Mohe lined up on the markers at the edge of the arena. From here the boy could see the northern mountains, their snowy ridges hovering faintly blue over the treeline of the forest. This was the only place in the village from which you could see the far mountain range. He was unable to focus on anything else as long as he could see them, as they reminded him of his father and the words that had been spoken to him the night he passed away.
  Being distracted he was slow off the mark and missed the timing of his throw. His spear wobbled in the air and landed at an odd angle, barely sticking into the ground. This was his worst performance yet and he knew it even before they measured the points. It had landed at least a few feet away, embarrasingly far.
  Mohe excitedly ran onto the arena where his spear stuck mere inches from the disc. When the points were counted up he had won by four points, three notches to Mika’s seven. Mohe was thrilled and ran about the whole arena, shouting to the other children that he had defeated the great player by a huge margin. Then he ran to the scorekeeper and made sure they had recorded it properly. The elders cheered him from afar, as they had started placing their bets on anyone who opposed the boy, his performance had been so bad.
  Truly he did not care. He sat down again on the sidelines and fixed his gaze on those faraway mountains. His friend approached and saw where he was looking, but said nothing.
  “The old men say your spear must be bad for you to be throwing like this. They say, Tye give him your spear and he will win again. This we know.”
  “They don’t know anything, old buzzards. Let them smoke their pipes and take cat naps.”
  “They worry about their wampum, that’s all.”
  Tye scanned the field and saw Mohe now among a group of girls who sat in a circle underneath an oak tree sewing bead necklaces. They looked annoyed at him. Leoti was among them. It was obvious most of his attention was given to her.
  “Mohe has been flirting with Leoti. I have seen it before. What do you think about that?”
  “Let him. I don’t care what that frog eater does.”
  Tye laughed. Then he dropped his own spear on the ground next to him.
  “Use mine. Challege him again, for me. I just want to see the look on that ugly face when you beat him. Imagine.”
  The boy looked at his friend with a curious expression.
  “My spear is good. See for yourself.”
  Tye picked up the spear and examined it. He felt the leather straps and ran his hand along the spine, looking for any imperfection, but found nothing.
  “Your spear is good. No splinters. No warp. How did you lose?”
  The boy once more looked to the mountains. He did not want to say exactly what it was that troubled him.
  “My head is not right ever since my father passed.”
  His friend nodded. He too looked towards the mountains but did not understand their significance.
  “Time will make it better,” Tye said, “You will see.” His brother had died in a hunting accident two summers ago, so he understood loss and therefore spoke from a place of wisdom. He rose and clasped one hand on the shoulder of his friend and stared him in the eyes.
  “You are the best of them all, and don’t forget it. There is nobody in the village who can defeat you in tchungkee.”
  Tye left to join a game of dice that had just started on the other side of the field, but shouted over his shoulder.
  “Except for me, of course.”
  He smiled and waved his friend away. A few moments later his eyes went back to the mountains. Then much later he rose and went to find his mother.
  Ama sat outside with a group of young girls, teaching them how to flesh deer hides for the tanning process. When she scraped the broad, flint blade down the hide draped over the wooden incline her shoulder muscles rippled. She moved like a woman twenty years younger than she was. When the girls took their clumsy turns at the hide it merely served to show how adept the old woman was at her work. But she was patient and kind and therefore was a good teacher to them.
  When she saw her son approach she wiped her hands on her apron and embraced him. It was obvious from the way he appeared, head down and thoughtful, that something was the matter.
  “Let us walk,” she said.
  Ama told the girls to finish the hide they were working on and then take a break.
  “May we go for a swim?”
  "Yes, you may."
  The children cheered and clapped. Ama and her son walked together along the path that led outside the village gates. The doors were opened this time of year and from here they could hear echoes of the games in the arena, shouts and laughter.
  “Why are you not with your friends?”
  “I was,” the boy began, “but I lost a game of tchungkee to Mohe. The elders no longer bet on the strength of my spear.”
  “Is that why you are sad?”
  He said nothing, only looked at her.
  “Of course it isn’t,” Ama pushed back his hair over his ears, “Now tell me what troubles you.”
  The boy wondered if he should confess everything to her now, unburden his heart to those eyes so full of understanding. But no, not even she could be told.
  “Father asked something of me on the night he died. And ever since that night his voice is always on my mind. Even though life has returned to normal, it’s always there. Nagging me. I tell myself, Mika, there is no rush. It can wait. There is time enough to do it later. But when I try to enjoy the things I did before, I cannot. Because of the voice, you see. Because of what he asked of me.”
  The boy stopped on the path and his mother did the same. He glanced to the direction of the mountains, though they were hidden by hills from here. Ama followed his gaze but did not ask why he looked there. She only listened.
  “I want things to go back how they were before, when life was fun and free of care. I want to play with my friends again, without those words of my father there. Its pulls me away from them.”
  Then he said no more. He looked more lost than ever. Ama gave for a moment and then her eyes brightened.
  “Look at me, Mika.”
  He did so.
  “Your heart is like a path diverged. One goes this way and one goes that. To find peace again, you must discover the place where the two paths converge back into one. Then you will play with your friends, like it was before. But cheer up for now. If you have to walk another path, your friends will wait for your return. So will I. And the reason for that is because you are loved, Mika. Remember that.”
  The boy’s eyes welled with tears.
  “Is it all true?”
  “I believe so.”
  They hugged and then returned inside the gates of the village. The late afternoon sun shined through the spaces between the palisades and lit geometric patterns onto the grass. It was dinner time and in the air was the aroma of barbecued fish and cornbread baking on the fire.
  
  The boy woke before dawn. He rose quietly from his bed so not to wake his mother, who was asleep in the next room. In the dim light he found his knife and sheath, and slung the traveling pouch over his shoulder. Inside the pouch was the food his mother had prepared the night before, many slabs of fresh deer pemmican. There was no real need to carry water as he would be following the river and could drink from it whenever thirsty. He also brought flint for lighting fires and a line for catching fish. Outside their homestead was a small shed his father had used for the storage of personal farming equipment and hunting gear. he rattled through the contents of the shed as quietly as he could until his hands landed on the old bucket they used when irrigating their own crops. Because they hadn’t grown their own vegetables in a few seasons the bucket was filled with debris. He emptied it onto the ground and took it with him.
  With these few items the boy stepped onto he path that headed outside the northern gates. He followed the torchlight and looked up at the dark blue of the morning skies beyond the black shapes of the trees. As he approached the gates he saw the morning lookout, a boy his own age named Gawoni, fast asleep underneath a platform built for archers. He went over to the boy and gave him a hard kick in the shins.
  “Let me out of here, you lazy dog.”
  Gawoni startled out of his sleep with his fists up, ready for a fight. The boy laughed.
  “What’s so funny?” He stretched both arms above his head and yawned like a mountain lion. “I was awake the whole time. Don’t tell anybody, okay?”
  “Don’t tell anybody you were awake?”
  Again he asked the lookout to open the gates. Gawoni looked at him puzzled.
  “Where are you going outside the northern gates this early?”
  “I am going to do what my father asked of me.”
  “But where?”
  “To the north. To the mountains in the north.”
  “But, why?”
  “That I cannot say.”
  “Those mountains are far. Too far to travel on foot. How long will you be gone?”
  “However long it takes.”
  “Which road will you travel?”
  “It’s too early for this.”
  “It’s my job to ask.”
  “The river will guide me there. Its source is in those mountains. So have I been told.”
  “So you intend to follow the river, and not the roads?”
  “The roads do not go to the mountains.”
  Gawoni considered this.
  “You are a strange one, Mika. And stupid.”
  “Why stupid?”
  “Don’t you know where the river to the north will take you, even before you leave the valley?”
  Then he did remember and went suddenly cold. The river to the north wound straight through the forbidden gorge. It was a dark place cut deep into the mountains, permanently bathed in dusklight, from both the high steepness of the hills and the dense oaks near the top of the ridge, which blocked out any light that would enter there. Yet it wasn’t the unnatural darkness that made the place forbidden to their people. The gorge was also home to a Raven Mocker, or so the legend told.
