HUNGER

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver along a pathway lit by torchlight. It was springtime and the night air sharply cold. Because the old woman had given him no time to dress, all he had on was his loincloth and leggings and the mocassins on his feet. Bare from the waist up he tucked both hands under his armpits for warmth and followed her. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they went he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. Fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills of the valley and obscured the houses on either side of the path. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her gray head, where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like two snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. She parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. The boy entered alone.
  Yaholo, an apprentice of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the house. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand the apprentice carried an eagle claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he chanted the words of the death ritual.
  His mother, a mature woman named Ama, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her chest, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
  The revered medicine man of their village lay upon a meager bed, wrapped in skins. His eyes were fixed on a faraway place that no one else could see. He lay utterly still except for the gasps for air that came after long and irregular intervals. At times his eyes rolled back in his head. His name was Sakima.
  No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took his hand into his own.
  “Father,” the boy said, kneeling beside him. Tears welled in his eyes but he held them back so to appear strong.
  The boy said nothing else, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet his lips he came around again. Sakima’s eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. A tear rolled down the side of his cheek and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own, and squeezed weakly.
  “Beautiful boy,” the old man said, “come and see.”
  The boy placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled a bitter salve. He felt the heartbeat within, rapid and then slow, strong and then weak. The boy stayed that way for a long time. They did not speak. He knew his father only wanted to be close to him for a little while.
  Underneath the table along the wall the boy saw a brown chicken pecking for seeds in the corner, oblivious to all else in the room. Concerned only with its own mindless existence. Pecking in the dirt while his father lay dying. The boy watched it for awhile and grew angry. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
  Then his father whispered into his ear and everything he saw instantly dimmed and every sound, except for the words he spoke, instantly grew silent. Sakima asked something of his son, a secret will, to him alone. The act of speaking itself seemed to cause the old man pain. When finished he collapsed onto the bed and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had understood the words. So strange they were. So like a dream. 
  He saw his mother in the corner, weepping into her hands. He went to console her. Yaholo approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton of soapstone from his medicine bag and shook it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He appeared to be in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with unnatural strength.
  Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this sound his father let out a scream unlike anything he had ever heard.
  Sakima was awake. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and shouted in anger at Yaholo, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his apprentice’s eyes yet he continued to utter the chants of the ritual. Then he glanced at his son. His eyes were wild and fearful and the boy did not recognize him from the loving memory he had of him.
  “Do what I ask of you.”
  Then he collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later became silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
  He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside  into the fog, unsure of where he was going. He ran for minutes while groping ahead for something familiar to him. And finally he reached a place he recognized and stopped. 
  At the base of the tree which was planted in the middle of the ceremonial grounds. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It’s bark was petrified, smooth and stone-like. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. It was sacred to the village. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” his father had replied with patience, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures which must have inhabited the earth when it lived and had perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
  Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and stars were visible in the sky. The moon was low. The morning was yet to come. He fell asleep against the trunk, shivering and goosefleshed, and he did not dream. Later, after his father had passed from this world, his mother covered him up with a blanket and brushed back his hair and kissed his forehead gently.

  For seven days the village mourned. For seven days they fasted. The worst of it was whenever he went outside and gazed upwards. There were skies of the deepest blue and clouds of the purest white, a mild breeze. How at odds to the thunderstorms and darkened vistas he felt inside himself. He hated every beautiful thing and spent those days crying and beating on his chest until it was bruised. Together he sat with his mother and her sister outside their homestead. The women expressed their sorrow in an endless chant where they repeated the name of the departed until they were breathless. His nephews and cousins covered themselves in ashes and sliced their fingertips with tiny shards of flint. Neighbors wept inside their homes. All were forbidden to laugh or smile or even to speak a light word during this time.
  Then it was over and by the next morning things appeared back to normal. The boy looked out of the window of their house. He saw people going back and forth, some his friends, carrying materials for building and baskets of food. Though the period of mourning was over his heart was still low, as if it had no bottom. As the son of Sakima he was not required to participate in the work for the funeral rites that evening, but he felt like it might do him good to put his body to use in some way. So he went outside and headed to the ceremonial grounds with the others.
  A platform constructed from reeds was being raised in the center of the grounds, near the trunk of the great tree and the high mound upon which rested the council house, where the chief resided. The boy set immediately to work with the others, lashing together the platform with strips of buckskin. If any of the others noticed him as the son of the departed they did not say so. They treated him like any other and that was good.
  The remainder of the day he helped with the preparations. By now the sun was going down and shined through the treetops. The boy was covered with dirt and his arms and back ached from the labor of the day. He sat and watched the women set up tables near the platform and then dishes of all kinds were brought out and arranged upon them. Roasted deer meat, pork, rabbit and other game were at the center. Then surrounding those steaming dishes were bowls filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and his favorite, kanuchi soup, which is made from hickory nuts.
  Families from the surrounding valley were starting to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful clothes. He saw his own family arrive from the other side of the village, Ama and her sister Ayita with her husband and two boys. When his mother saw him she looked disapprovingly at his soiled clothes and dirty face and spit on her hand to wipe him clean.
  “Go prepare yourself.”
  By the time he returned it was evening. He walked among the crowds who were eating and drinking, laughing together and telling stories. The boy was not hungry himself and resented their carefree attitudes. He hid from his family, who sat on a bench near the base of the tree. He found a spot away from the crowds and crouched in the grass to watch them. He wanted to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the tree whose shadowed branches spiraled towards the muted skies of the evening. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. Then he remembered what his father had asked of him. He had not thought of that once since the night, strangely, but now it returned to him and he vowed he would never forget again. He thought to share his words with the people could be a good thing. It could be.
  At last the elders emerged from the council house and descended into the ceremonial grounds. There were five of them total and they were dressed in magnificent garb. The most delicate deerskins covered in beads and feathers. Their faces were painted red and white. Kulsathee, the old chief of peace, led them with a solemn frown. When they reached the benches at the foot of the tree they turned to face the people gathered. But their gaze was fixed on the two men who approached the funeral platform with the body of the departed medicine man.
  When the boy saw the body of Sakima, who had been anointed with oils and covered in dark paint, then dressed in a ritual gown, nothing like what he normally wore, he wept. The bearers reached the platform and lifted the body onto it. Then a group of them together lifted the platform onto the tall legs, where it fit into slots. They brought all of his belongings out and laid them at the base of the platform. Wood was brought and arranged for the burning. Another young man carried the tinder close to the pyramid of kindling and fuel wood and used a block of flint to start the fire. It caught quickly and within minutes the entire platform was engulfed in flames, an bright orange glow cast onto the faces of the people who had loved him most.
  So bright it burned that even the boy was no longer completely hidden in the shadows. He watched the flames consume his father. Plumes of dark smoke and flecks of embered ash rolled into the air above them. He turned to the crowd and there among them he saw a pair of eyes staring back at him. His friend Tye, who was a hunter like himself, and therefore trained to see things that wanted to remain out of sight. Tye was savvy. He would respect his wishes and not approach his friend in mourning. Instead he made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, this was a secret  symbol of their friendship. The boy returned the gesture from his spot in the darkness. His true friend.
  Yet someone else had discovered him there in the flickering light of the funeral pyre, approaching him from the side so not to be detected. She emerged carrying food. The light from the funeral fire was reflected in her eyes and her long, braided hair shimmered, smooth and flowing like a dark river. Leoti was beautiful indeed. She placed a bowl of kanuchi on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. He gazed upon her and then at the bowl, steam rising from it in the cool air.
  “Eat, Mika.”
  “I’m not hungry.”
  But he knew it was not a request, and that she would not leave him be until he ate something, so he picked up the bowl and drank the soup down with only a few gulps. It was good, rich and sweet. Leoti then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. It was still warm and the grease seeped through the wrappings.
  “Eat.”
  He ate the bread and meat too and then invited her to sit next to him. She did so. He noticed she did not try to console him though he saw the look of pity in her eyes. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how truly hungry he was. They sat together while the fire burned. He was happy she was here. He looked at the people gathered and saw them differently than before. He saw the love that had brought them together and that this love was not something to be take for granted. He felt that love himself and no longer wanted to be alone. He took Leoti by the hand and led them to the benches where his family sat. Ama received them with tenderness.
  As the evening went on people came by to pay respects. When it was very late and the fire had burned low the people who remained came closer and they each took turns telling stories about the old medicine man. Each story surprised the boy because it was like they were talking about someone other than his father. 
  At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the circle of elders. He was a large, rotund man with long graying hair. He was the chief of peace and had been the leader of their tribe ever since before the boy was born. There were deep lines in his face and whenever he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather. His eyes were red and cheeks were wet from many tears.
  “All the old things are gone now and the people are different.  When we were boys Sakima and I roamed these forests and hunted together. Even then he was drawn to the mysteries of nature. He would commune with the spirit of the trees to reveal where the rabbits were hidden. We caught so many! It is true I loved Sakima, whom you all knew, from the time we were both boys and had our whole lives in ahead of us. He was my good friend and I will miss him.”
  It was in the lull between speakers that the boy felt compelled himself to speak. He rose and approached the center of the circle, near the remnants of the pyre, whose embers glowed a dull orange and radiated heat like ripples in the air. Nobody said anything when they saw him rise. The chief went to him and took hold of both his arms in the gesture of great kinship, and then returned to his seat with the other elders.
  Moments passed. The boy looked into the crowd and saw their hopeful and expectant faces. He knew they wanted to hear something about his father. Something fond and hopeful. But no words came. After a few minutes the people stirred. They grew restless and impatient. Some in the crowd put it down to youthful shyness. Some took it as disrespect on his part. Some pitied the boy. Some said he was not the man his father was.

  It was the season of abundance in the valley. The forests and meadows had turned green and blossomed with a myriad of wildflowers and berries. The river which ran close to the village, and irrigated their crops, glimmered the mild afternoon sunlight. Women went daily to its banks and pulled fish from traps that had been set just below the mild rapids. These fish they roasted that same evening for dinner, there being no need to dry and salt them for storage. Men hunted game in the nearby woods, or did carpentry work that had been put off during the winter. They fixed leaky roofs and built summer shelters for the elders, which allowed the breeze to blow through. The younger children played hide and seek in the village and surrounding wilds. They went shirtless and ate blackberries until their fingers and mouths were stained purple. The older children gathered in the wide open space on the southern edge of the village grounds. Here a field had been cleared of all grass and shrubs so that only the dirt ground remained. The ground had been hardened by many years of footsteps and weather, so that it was nearly polished. Here they played dice and other ball games. Stick ball was popular but the game that required the most skill was tchungkee.
  This was a game for hunters since it required the use of a flat-tipped spear. A small, stone disc the size of a grapefruit was rolled into the center of a demarcated arena. The hunters stood at the edge and threw their spears where they thought the disc would end up, based on its often unpredictable path. Points were distributed by whose spear landed nearest the disc. Tchungkee was so popular that many elders, who were no longer required to farm or hunt during the day, set up ramadas on the edge of the field and smoked tobacco while placing bets on the games.
  For many seasons now the best player in the village was himself. This was well known and there was even a rule put in place by the gamblers so one could not bet on him more than four times in one day. Yet, ever since his the passing of his father, his game had fallen off considerably. He was no longer the sure bet he used to be and both the elders and certain children were beginning to take advantage of it.
  Mohe, an athletic but not particularly bright boy, had challenged him to a game earlier that morning. He had not felt like playing today, but when he saw the expectant faces of the elders at the other end he rose from the sidelines, where he sat with Tye, and took up his spear.
  “I'll go easy on you today,” the other boy taunted him. He twirled his spear upright and deftly threw it at a practice target a little ways from them.
  He ignored his rival and ran his hands along the grain of his spear, then walked to the arena. The disc tosser got in position and gave the ready signal with a wave of his hand. They lined up on the markers at the edge. From here the boy could see the northern mountains, their snowy ridges hovering faintly blue over the treeline of the forest. This was the only place in the village from which you could see them.
  The tosser pitched the disc into the arena. Being distracted the boy was slow off the mark and missed the timing of his throw. His spear wavered clumsily in the air and landed at an odd angle, barely sticking into the ground. This was his worst performance yet and he knew it even before they took measurements. It had landed a few feet away. Embarrasingly far.
  His rival ran onto the arena where his spear stuck mere inches from the disc and gloated over it. When the points were counted up he had won by a total of four points, three notches to the boy’s seven. Mohe was thrilled and ran to and fro, shouting to the other children that he had defeated the champion by a huge margin. The elders cheered Mohe from afar, as they had started placing their bets on anyone who opposed him, and they had won big.
  Truly the boy did not care. He sat down again on the sidelines and fixed his gaze on those faraway mountains. Tye approached and noticed where he was looking, but saw nothing of significance about them.
  “The old men say your spear must be bad for you to be throwing like this. They say, Tye give him your spear and he will win again. This we know.”
  “They don’t know anything, old buzzards,” the boy scoffed, “Let them stick to smoking their pipes and taking cat naps, for all I care”
  “They worry about their wampum. It’s all they have to do.”
  “I know.”
  Tye scanned the field and saw Mohe now among a group of girls who sat in a circle underneath an oak tree sewing bead necklaces. They looked annoyed at him. Leoti was among them. It was obvious most of his attention was given to her.
  “Mohe has been flirting with Leoti. I have seen him do it before. What do you think about that?”
  “Let him. I don’t care what that frogeater does.”
  His friend dropped his own spear on the ground next to him.
  “Use my spear. Challege him again. I just want to see the look on his ugly face when he’s beaten square.”
  The boy looked up, puzzled.
  “My spear is good, Tye. See for yourself.”
  His friend picked up the spear and examined it. He felt the leather straps and ran his hand along the spine, looking for any imperfection, but found nothing.
  “Your spear is good. No splinters, no warp. But how did you lose?”
  The boy once more looked to the mountains. His silence made Tye thoughtful. “Time will make things better,” he said, “You’ll see.” His brother had died in a hunting accident two summers ago and spoke from a place of wisdom. Then he rose and clasped one hand on Mika’s shoulder and stared him in the eyes.
  “You are the best of them all, Mika. And don’t forget it. There is nobody in this village who can defeat you in the game of tchungkee.”
  His friend departed in order to join a game of dice that had just begun on the other side of the field. As he went he shouted over his shoulder.
  “Except for me, of course.”
  The boy smiled lamely and waved his friend away. A few moments later his eyes went back to the mountains. He looked at them for a long time. Much later he rose and went to find his mother.
  Ama sat outside with a group of young girls, teaching them how to flesh deer hides for the tanning process. When she scraped the broad, flint blade down the hide draped over the wooden incline her shoulder muscles rippled. She moved like a woman twenty years younger than she was. When the girls took their clumsy turns at the hide it merely served to show how adept the old woman was at her work. But she was patient and kind and therefore was a good teacher to them.
  When she saw her son approach she wiped her hands on her apron and embraced him. It was obvious from the way he appeared, head down and thoughtful, that something was the matter.
  “Let us walk,” she said.
  Ama told the girls to finish the hide they were working on and then take a break.
  “May we go for a swim?”
  “You may."
  The children cheered and happily resumed their task. Ama and her son walked together along the path that led outside the village gates. The doors were opened this time of year and from here they could hear echoes of the games in the arena, playful shouting and joyful laughter.
  “Why are you not with your friends?”
  “I was,” the boy began, “but I lost a game to Mohe. The elders no longer bet on the strength of my spear.”
  “Is that why you’re sad?”
  He said nothing, but looked at her.
  “Of course it isn’t,” Ama observed. She pushed back his hair over his ears, “Now tell me what troubles you.”
  The boy wanted to confess everything to his mother, unburden his heart to those eyes, so full of understanding.
  “Father asked something of me the night he died. In secret. Ever since, it is always on my mind. Even though things have returned to normal, it’s there. I tell myself, Mika, there is no rush. It can wait. There will be time for that later. Yet when I try to enjoy the things I did before, there is no joy in them.”
  The boy stopped on the path. His mother did the same. He glanced to the direction of the mountains, though they were obscured by hills from here. Ama followed his gaze but did not ask why he looked there. She listened.
  “I want things to go back how they were before, when life was free of cares. I want to play with my friends again.”
  The boy looked more lost than ever.
  “Listen to me, dear.”
  He did so.
  “The way I see things, your heart is like a path diverged. One goes this way and one goes that way. To have peace again you must walk this new path for a time, and find where the two converge back into one. Only then can life go back to how it was before. But cheer up. If you have to walk another path for awhile, so what? Your friends will await your return. And so will I and all in the village. The reason is you are loved, Mika. Remember that.”
  The boy dried his eyes. Then he smiled.
  “Is it really true?”
  “I believe so.”
  They embraced and then returned inside the gates. The late afternoon sun shone through the cracks in the palisades and lit geometric patterns on the grass where they walked. It was dinner time and in the air was an aroma of barbecued fish and cornbread baking on the fire.
  
  The boy woke before dawn. He rose quietly from his bed so not to wake his mother, who was asleep in the next room. In the dim light he found his knife and sheath, and slung the traveling pouch over his shoulder. Inside the pouch was the food his mother had prepared the night before, many slabs of fresh deer pemmican. There was no real need to carry water as he would be following the river and could drink from it whenever thirsty. He also brought flint for lighting fires. Outside their homestead was a small shed his father had used for the storage of personal farming equipment and hunting gear. he rattled through the contents of the shed as quietly as he could until his hands landed on the old bucket they used when irrigating their own crops. Because they had not grown their own vegetables in a few seasons the bucket was filled with debris. He emptied it onto the ground and took it with him.
  With these few items the boy stepped onto he path that headed outside the northern gates. He followed the torchlight and looked up at the dark blue of the morning skies beyond the black shapes of the trees. As he approached the gates he saw the morning lookout, a boy his own age named Gawoni, fast asleep underneath a platform built for archers. He went over to the boy and gave him a gentle kick in the shins.
  “Let me out of here.”
  Gawoni startled out of his sleep with his fists up, ready for a fight. He stretched both arms above his head and yawned like a mountain lion.
	“I was awake the whole time.”
  Again the boy demanded the lookout open the gates for him. Gawoni looked at him puzzled.
  “Where are you going this early in the morning?”
  “To fulfill an obligation.”
  “But, where?”
  “To the north. To the mountains.”
  “Why go there?”
  “That I cannot say.”
  “Those mountains are very far from here. Too far to travel on foot. How long will you be gone?”
  “However long it takes me.”
  “What road will you travel?”
  “The river will guide me there. Its source is in those mountains, so have I been told.”
  “You intend to follow the river and not the road?”
  “The road does not go to the mountains.”
  Gawoni considered this.
  “You are a strange one, Mika, and brave. Don’t you know where the river north will take you, even before you leave the valley?”
  Then the boy did remember and went suddenly cold. The river to the north cut straight through the a gorge that was forbidden among the tribe. This was a dangerous place in the hills, permanently bathed in dusklight. The ravine cut a deep gash in the surrounding hills and dense, ancient oaks on the ridge blocked out any sunlight that might enter there. Yet it was not the unnatural darkness that made the gorge forbidden. It was also home to a Raven Mocker, or so the legend told.
 She was a malevolent witch who existed by feeding on the souls of the sick and dying, thereby extending her own life. She has the ability to go unseen or to take on the form of those who souls she has robbed. The only way to know of her presence is from the sound of her scream, like a multitude of ravens, whenever out hunting prey.
  The old men in the village told stories of hearing the Raven Mocker at the edge of the gorge when they were children. Then there were also stories of dead souls, those whose souls had been sucked out by the witch and from them on walked around with nothing inside them. Outward they looked normal but inward they were hollow and had no heart. Thus the gorge had been declared forbidden by the chief and elders, and ever since then no one from their village had dared to go there.
  Gawoni pushed open the large gate door just enough for the boy to leave. He picked up the bucket and pulled tight the strap of the pouch which hung at his side. Then he walked outside the gates and immediately heard the latch close behind him. From within he heard the lookout call to him.
  “Be safe on your journey, my friend.”
  It was just before sunrise and a pastel glow from behind the hills gave him light enough to find the river. When he got near it he heard the calms waters trickling over stones and fallen limbs, lapping up against the grassy banks. He cupped his hands into the water and drank. It was very cold. He followed the river all morning. At certain times he glanced back to see whether his village was yet out of sight. For some time it was there, until once he looked and it was gone.
  He followed the river for days, camping alongside it once the evening came, cooking slices of pemmican for dinner. The weather was fine, with clear skies and a gentle breeze. Because he was so tired the food always tasted good. For the same reason he slept hard and woke well-rested in the morning.
  One afternoon he came to a bend in the river. Beyond that he knew was the entrance to the gorge he had been warned about. He rested in the crook of a birch tree and when finished his lunch and set off towards the bend, feeling a sense of dread inside. At the bend he stopped and listened for anything out of the ordinary. He himself had never heard the shrieks of the Raven Mocker, but he knew those who said they had. After a few minutes of waiting and hearing nothing but the sounds of the forest he continued on. 
  Here the slope of the hills became steeper and the light tapered off the further he went. Though he knew the sun was overhead the entire place shadowed like it was during an eclipse. It was an unreal, dreamlike view. Because of the incline the trees leaned over and covered the whole area. The water of the river became darkened and its sound echoed faintly on the inclines. The boy went further. The narrow banks grew narrower. There was not much room for him to walk. On his left the river and on his right the steep hillside rose, much too steep for him to navigate. And then he heard shrill bird-like shrieks echoing. Bouncing off the slopes of the ravine the noise came, to his ears full of rage and malintent. He stooped behind a fallen stump and shut his eyes. It was true, after all. The witch was real. The shrieks came again and it was just as described in the legends, a unearthly scream like a cacaphony of multitudinous birds.
  Now was the time when he had to decide whether to go on or turn back. To follow the river out of the valley he had to continue on this path. There was no way around the gorge that was known to him. To navigate around it could take weeks of walking. But to go on he would risk facing it. In his mind the image of the Raven Mocker grew, her wide spread of wings beating the wind and trailing behind her was a tail of flames.
  Later the shrieking stopped. How long he found it hard to tell. He rose from behind the stump and walked beside the banks of the river. At another bend, a mile or so from where he entered the gorge, the bottom widened and spread into a meadow of a kind, filled with rotted trees that had fallen from the high slopes. There were mushrooms growing out of many of them, of all shapes and colors. None he recognized at a distance. The grass was damp and the soil soft. His mocassins sunk in with each step, so he tread lightly. The air was cool, but there was a musty smell from the flora decomposing that made him reluctant to breathe it in. Then he saw it. Somehow he had reached it in the shadows unaware, until it was right in front of him.
  An enormous boulder, a fractured section of the ravine walls, set in the middle of the meadow. Upon its plateaus sat perched a horde of crows, hundreds of them.
  The boy peddled backwards but had no good place to hide. So he stood there. And he looked.
  The birds shrieked once more and at this close distance the sound pierced his eardrums and he covered them with both hands. Again the sound echoed off the high walls of the gorge and repeated in ever-diminishing volume. As his eyes adjusted to the strangeness of them he started to notice the individual birds. He saw their sharp, black beaks and the jerky way they moved back and forth. Covering the nooks they sat upon was ages upon ages of droppings, white and waxlike. They were birds.
  The boy stood and gave a wide berth as he walked by. He stepped lightly so not to startle them but there were leaves and twigs on the ground, crackling underfoot. All at once the entire horde ruffled their feathers and let out shrieks. He dropped to his knees and covered his ears. Then he felt a beating on the wind and looked and saw the crows had taken flight. Like a single organism they rose into the air and swirled above the river and flew up out of the ravine in graceful synchronicity.
  The boy got to his feet and listened but there was only the sound of the riverflow. He kept walking, keeping as close to the banks as he could. Several hours later he reached the edge of the gorge, where it opened into a wide clearing. There he stopped and made a fire and rested for the evening.
  
  After the gorge he walked through several large, wide fields. Trees grew sparse here. The boy was not used to open spaces and looked up at those big skies in awe. The grass came up past his knees and was crushed flat underfoot. He had arrived at the verge of the prairie and further than he had ever been from home. He took a couple days to rest at the verge, camped under a row of maple trees. The river flattened as if to mirror the landscape. Its waters turned clear and he make out pebbles and sediment along the bottom. The boy went for swims naked in the frigid waters and dried out in the sun. He cooked pemmican over the fire when he was hungry, or sometimes he ate it raw.
  Daily he set out on the prairie. Each morning there were fewer and fewer trees and then one morning there were none. He found himself in the middle of a vast ocean of gentle knolls and pale green grass. There was a wind out there that never ceased. It blew from the west and rippled the grass for miles like water. Above the horizon he could see the hazy outline of the mountain range. His craggy goal. At the beginning of each day the boy fixed his eyes upon it and went towards it. Yet when the evening came he appeared no closer and became dishearted. Soon he learned to fix his eyes on nearby landmarks instead, like the sloping hills or cottonwood trees on the banks of the river, and use them to measure his progress.
  He never thought about home. As he traveled through the plains the austerity of the empty landscape somehow entered into him. There was a silence in his heart, a calmness, that he had never known before. It was a kind of joy, though not superficial or outward. His mind was entirely blank. It was as if his entire existence had become the physical act of placing one foot in front of the other, hour after hour, day after day, in complete service towards reaching the mountain range his goal. And nothing more. When he rested at sundown and cooked pemmican over the fire it was so that he had strength to go on tomorrow.
  One day the boy counted the provisions in his satchel and determined that at his current rate of progress he would run out of food before he even reached the high plains. It had not occurred to him just how far away they were, and how long it would take to get there. Another thing was the fact that seemed to be no wildlife to hunt. No game or fowl. No insects. And no edible vegetation, no fruits or nuts to gather. During his frequent swims he had seen fish in the river from time to time, and heard them splash in the twilight, when the sun was going down. So that gave him some hope. Because of all these things the boy cut back on his daily rations. He sliced the slabs of pemmican into quarters and allowed himself one morsel at every meal. It was not enough to keep him strong, but it kept him going until he could figure out what to do.
  The weather held. Blue skies most days and only the occassional spring rainstorm. When it was bad he fashioned a lean-to from his bedroll and some twigs and nestled inside to keep himself dry. But most days the sun was bright and hot, and since there was no shade except for the occassional cottonwood tree, he got blisters on his face and neck and forearms. The burn on his neck got so bad he would sometimes douse his shirt in the river and drape it over his shoulders for an afternoon, just for some relief from the heat.
  The bucket also wore blisters on his palms. He regularly switched hands and tried to ignore it, but then the skin broke and started to bleed and it was a knife sticking into him. For this he wrapped the handle with a bunch of grassblades. It helped a little.
  Then his shoes fell apart. The stitching came loose and created holes where dirt or tiny pieces of grass could get in, irritating the skin. The boy had not prepared his footwear for such a journey. He ought to have reinforced them with more hardened leather, and cursed himself for not remembering. But it was too late now. As the shoes disintegrated they fit looser and wore blisters on his heels and the bottoms of his toes. At night, by campfire light, he soaked his feet in the river and washed the dried blood and dirt from them. That helped to ease the pain. Yet because the shoes were in such poor condition the cycle repeated the next day. Eventually he had to stop and rest every other day to allow his feet to heal before continuing on the path. This compounded the problem of his food running out. Finally, as a way to keep moving, he stripped his shirt into pieces and with some woven grass as line he wrapped the soles for padding.
  The lack of food along with the blisters and sunburns slowly wore the boy down. Evenings he lay under the stars unable to sleep and tried to ignore the sores, but it seemed no matter which way he turned some part of him was irritated. And because he got no good rest he was groggy in the daylight hours and became easily frustrated. He cursed at minor things, like the grassblades tickling his thighs or how cold the river water was. Once he lost his temper and flew into a rage, becoming red in the face and beating on the ground with his fists.
  He attempted to catch fish in the river to supplement the pemmican, but line to fish with was another thing he had not brought along. He fashioned a trap with the empty bucket. That did not work very well. Then he tried to make a line and lure with some woven grass but that too failed to catch any. He last tried to grab a fish barehanded, using the tickle technique, but they were too quick for him in his weakened state.
  “How weak you are,” the boy said aloud, “You are soft and weak. This path is not for the weak but for the strong. And you are not strong. You are pitiful!”
  The moon was obscured by high clouds which moved fast across the night sky. He lay there hurting and missed his home. He thought of his mother and his friends and all the people he loved in the village, and who loved him. Under the immensity of the night skies the boy felt his insignificance. And very alone.
  In the morning he ate breakfast, packed up the camp, and returned to the path. His back was to the mountains.
  It was a early afternoon when he rounded the final bend of the river and saw the familiar wooden palisades which protected his village. The gates were opened so he walked straight through. Everything was just as it had been when he left. Several villagers noticed the boy and their eyes widened.
  “Mika, where have you been?”
  “Doesn’t he look different?”
	“He does. Older somehow.”
  Yet he did not answer them. He went straight to the summer house he shared with his family this time of year. His mother sat under the shade of a ramada, boiling beans in a pot over a small fire pit. Ama looked up and gasped. She smiled, proudly.
  “You have returned! How thin you are!”
  She asked her son to come inside. He set the bucket against the house and followed her. After he cleaned himself, he put on fresh clothes and ate a meal she had prepared, roasted chicken with frybread, beans, and a bowl of macerated strawberries for dessert. He scarfed the food like an animal. His rations had run out as he entered the valley so it had been days since his last meal. Once he was finished he looked up and saw his mother staring at him. Her eyes were filled with pride. She said nothing about the journey and yet for the rest of the day he caught her beaming whenever she thought he wasn’t looking. 
  Because he was exhausted the boy went to sleep while it was daylight still. He crawled into his bed and pulled the skins over his head to block out the light and to hide his shame.

  He and Leoti walked together near a pond. It was early morning and a mist rose over the gray waters. They came to the sitting log and sat upon it. A water strider darted out of the grass across the surface of the pond and left a trail of ripples. Not many in the village were yet awake. That was part of the reason they liked to meet at this hour. It made it feel like somehow everything belonged to them. They watched the sun come up over the hillside, holding hands.
  After, Leoti went to wake her brothers and to prepare breakfast for the family. The boy headed back to their homestead and started his chores. He scooped some feed into a basket and went around back where there was a tiny shed with an open front. Inside was a bed of straw. This is where the chickens slept.
  One of the chickens lay on its side. The boy poked it and saw that it had died. Its eyes were covered over by a milky film. Then he looked into the shed and saw that all of them were dead. There was no blood or any sign a fox had entered. On the hay he saw some kernals of corn. They were partially covered in a black fur, some kind of fungus. He had never seen anything like it before. He ran his hand through the feed in the basket and saw some kernals covered in the same fur. He wiped his hand on the ground and looked towards the center of the village. There was some activity there. He headed there with the basket of contaminated feed.
  At the central storehouse a group of villagers had gathered. Each one brought with them baskets full of contaminated seed and some of them had even brought dead livestock, like chickens or piglets, which they held up by the legs, at a safe distance.
  Yonaguska was the keeper of the storehouse and he was woken and brought to them. He wandered up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, and asked them, “What is so important to wake me this early?”
  When he saw the dead livestock and the contaminated grains his expression turned grave. He handed the cane he walked with to his son, who had come along with him and climbed up the small ladder to a platform where the entrance to the storehouse was. At the top he scraped his fingers along the edge of the hatch in order to break the clay sealing, and then set it against the wall. He lit the torch he carried in his belt and leaned forward to see inside. But he was unable to see very far. His son climbed up onto the platform and held the torch for him while he crawled through the tiny entrance. He was as small and wiry as a mouse, one of the reasons he had been given the responsibility, and disappared inside. His son held the torch at the door and there was stirring inside while everyone below awaited his discovery.
  When he emerged he climbed down and faced the crowd, which had doubled in number. He shook his head solemnly.
  “Most everything has been contaminated with the fungus. Corn, beans. The potatoes look good. I don’t know how this happened. The seals are in place. It’s as dry as a desert inside.”
  “What do we do now? My pigs are all dead.”
  “And my chickens.”
  “My rabbits too.”
  “That I cannot say,” Yonaguska said, “We need to inform the elders so they can hold council.” He turned to his son.
  “Run fetch Kulsathee. Fetch them all. Be quick!”
  His son ran off towards the townhouse.
  Kulsathee and the elders arrived soon after and were shown the contaminated stores and the dead animals who had consumed the fungus. The chief of peace immediately sent out a messenger, the lookout Gawoni, to tell those who lived within the village walls and also those who had homes in the surrounding hills, not to eat nor feed to livestock any of their provisions until further notice. He then asked to be shown the crops which no one else had thought to check.
  They walked as a group to the southern side of the village. There were large, squared-off fields, in rotation so that no soil was used more than twice in one year. Planted now was corn, squash, beans, pumpkins, potatoes, onions, and strawberries. There were women working the soil and they were asked to help inspect the vegetation. Row by row they crounched and picked through the leaves and stalks and held up specimens covered in the black fur. Again, all had been contaminated except for the potatoes. After that the elders went to the townhouse and held council for many hours.
  Gawoni returned later in the afternoon from the hills. He had reports from the families who lived there and from hunters who were in the forest. The fungus had infected their food supply also.
  “The hunters told me they had found game, deer and rabbits, who had eaten of the infected vegetation and died. They dared not to dress out those. The families too. They ask what will they eat?”
  Kulsathee and the elders deliberated and decided it was safe to eat potatoes. But that was all. They sent Gawoni out to inform the people in the valley. Then the elders asked Yaholo to perform medicine.
  “I will consult the book Sakima passed to me, and his master passed to him,” said the medicine man, “I will perform a cleansing ritual at the burning.”
  The elders sent word to every one in the village to come to the ceremonial grounds and to bring their contaminated food supplies for burning. And that evening they came, the entire population, about two hundred. They carried skins full of corn, beans, onions. All contaminated. It was everything they had, except for potatoes. A bonfire was lit and all their food was thrown upon it, to be incinerated. As their food burned the smoke turned blue-black and rolled upwards beyond the limbs of the ancient tree and dissipated in the night skies.
  The boy had come with his mother. He threw all their food onto the flames and watched the corn kernals pop and char. The onions wrinkled up in the embers. On the other side of the grounds he saw Leoti with her family. He went to her. It was only this morning they had sat by the pond and watched the sun rise. They looked at one another and the mournful look in both their eyes expressed that understanding without words. They stood together and held hands and watched the fire with everyone.
  Soon Yaholo entered the ceremonial grounds dressed in an elaborate coyote headdress and furs. He carried the large green soapstone baton that had been passed down from Sakima. He fastened rattles to his forearms and calves and a small skin drum was hung around his neck. His face was painted all black. Everyone grew quiet when they saw the impressive and solemn entrance. Helpers dragged seasoned cedar logs behind them and when the medicine man gave the word they set them on the fire.
  A distinctive cedar smell filled the air. The helpers themselves had drums and started to beat on them. Yaholo joined them. The beat was at first slow but increased in rhythm. At certain times the medicine man would begin a recitation.

  Out, evil medicine! Leave our crops immediately!
  Out, evil medicine! Leave our stores immediately!
  Out, evil medicine! Leave our village immediately!
  
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!
  Go back into the Darkness. Go back into the Heart of the World!

  The chanting of the ritual repeated seven times in total. On the final recitation his helpers joined in. The drums were beaten ferociously. Yaholo shook his arms and legs between the beat of the drums. Then in the silence immediately after he pulled four snake skins from his medicine bag which had been bound together. Then he removed a bag of herbs and sprinkled them onto the skins and tossed it into the flames.
  The boy watched the ritual with fascination. Yet he knew the words Yaholo spoke had no power to heal their food supply, because no one truly believed in them. Not Yaholo, nor his helpers, nor the elders, nor the villagers, nor himself. None believed. Yet they all pretended to, including the boy, because they had nothing else to give them hope.

  After the burning of the crops and all contaminated foodstores life went on. Villagers horded potatoes for their own families. Fights broke out when it came to distributing what remained of them from the town storage house, and some were left with little eat. Since nobody knew what would happen they rationed whatever potatoes they had.
  There was a family of six who lived outside the gates in the hills and they had no potatoes left. The father went from house to house in the village asking for help. But none wanted to give up their only foodsource, especially in this uncertain time, though some did give begrudgingly.
  “Tell me, why should I help you when did not even help yourself? Pure laziness, that’s all it is.”
  “You should have been prepared, like we are! You have a family. Look at you now, begging like a dog. I am ashamed for you.”
  This is what his neighbors said.
  The man, who was called Salal, came to the door of their homestead one afternoon, when the boy was repairing a hole in the roof. He climbed down and greeted the man who would not look him in the eyes. He stared at the ground and held a small, empty sack at his side.
  “Do you have any potatoes to spare?”
  The boy went inside. Ama came out a few minutes later, a small pile of potatoes in her apron. The boy came out behind her and stared at the man. When she gave him the pile he sobbed into his hands. His eyes were red and swollen.
  “Thank you, Ama. This means the world to my family. Truly you are the wife of Sakima. Thank you!”
  Salal collected the potatoes in a skin sack he dragged behind him and went to the next house.
  The boy looked at his mother.
  “Mama, why did you give him so many?” he asked. “We don’t have enough ourselves.”
  Ama did not answer. She went back inside and after a few moments the boy climbed back onto the roof and resumed his work. He watched Salal beg at the next homestead and leave empty handed. Later he came in exhausted and his mother had prepared a single roasted potato for them to eat. She broke it in half and set one piece into his bowl and the other into hers. They ate the meager meal in silence.
  One night a scream came from the house of Ninovan. The boy rose from his bed and went outside to see what was the matter. Others had also come out and they all looked in the direction of the house. Not long after a woman came running down the path, carrying a young boy, her son. His skin was blue and there was no life in his opened eyes. She ran to the townhouse and cried at the door. Kulsathee exited and called for Yaholo.
  The medicine man said a few words of purification, but there was nothing to be done for the boy. Yaholo looked up with helpless eyes and turned to the mother. She fell to her knees and held the body of her son. She wept.
  It was told how the boy had eaten a couple of potatoes earlier that evening with his mother and father. The elders asked to see their supply and they were brought in a basket. Upon examination they found traces of the black fungus on their potatoes.
  The village panicked.
  “What will we eat now?”
  “How am I going to feed my children?”
  “Why have the elders not come up with a plan?”
  Nobody slept that night from the fear that they or their loved ones might suffer the same fate as the house of Ninovan. 
  In the morning all were called to the ceremonial grounds. The elders had held council all through the night and would pass on their decision at this time.
  Under the tree the village gathered. Kulsathee led the elders out of the townhouse and down the steps into the grounds. They went to the log bench and sat down. The chief of peace alone rose and surveyed the faces of the people. His expression was solemn and when he began to speak the sound of his voice was like a large drum, definitive and booming.
  “You must know that a blight has come over our valley. It has affected our crops, our stores, and our livestock. It has contaminated plans in the wilds and therefore has also sickened or killed the game that roam our forests. We had thought that potatoes were safe, but only last night, as you all know by this point, a boy died from eating potatoes contaminated with the black fungus. His name was Kanuna and his loss is a devastation, an inconsolable loss. Such a bright boy, Kanuna. I remember him playing,”
  The old man’s voice broke and tears fell from his eyes. He paused for a few moments and continued, his voice not as resolute as before.
  “We do not know the source of this blight. We do know that it acts like a mold and will spread on contact. It seems to spread through all varieties of plants, grains, vegetables, and fruits. Although the fungus doe not seem to spread via animals or people, it can still make you sick, as we have learned. The most at risk our the very old or the very young.”
  “But what can we do?” A young father shouted, “How can we feed our families now, when the potatoes are contaminated? You said they were safe to eat!”
  Some in the crowd scolded the man for showing disrespect, but Kulsathee calmed them with a wave of his hand.
  “Do not blame this man for his outburst. This good father has asked what all of you want to know. I understand this well. Do not forget that I am also a father, and a grandfather, and soon to be a great grandfather!”
  He gestured to his large family sat nearby. His granddaugther rubbed her belly and smiled bashfully. Kulsathee regarded them with compassionate eyes.
  “Do not be afraid. Myself and the elders have held council all through the night. Since this came to pass we have also held council with the farmers and hunters among you, in order to see what can be done. And this is what we will do.”
  “Every man who is able to hunt will tomorrow set off on a journey to the next valley. We have sent a scout there and he has reported back the blight has not yet spread that far. It is a five day journey. We will enter the next valley to hunt deer, rabbit, and other game. Accompanying the men will be a small group of women, to gather nuts, and wild fruits and vegetables that can be dried. They will also stay at the base camp to dress the kills and to salt them for the journey back to the village.”
  “Because the best place for the hunters will be in the next valley, they will remain there and we will set up a system of checkpoints to deliver the food supply. Then, after a couple of weeks, the hunters will return to rest and to see their families. Then we start over again. By doing this we will be able to store enough food to last throughout the winter, and safely into the following year. Remember, the days are now long and warm, but we cannot forget they will not always be so. We must not forget that the Earth is bountiful but she is also unforgiving and harsh. Our people are strong and by working together we will overcome this blight. We will not starve!”
  
  It was a warm day in summer. The hunters crouched in the grass nearby a creek where the deer came to drink. A soft breeze blew across the clearing and rustled the leaves on the trees. Tye lashed the decoy to his right and crawled flat on his stomach to the edge of the water. He lifted the mock deer head just above the grass line and bobbed it up and down in a realistic manner. Then Mika placed his hands over his mouth and whistled like a bird, their agreed upon signal to one another while tracking prey in the neighboring valley. Tye knew from the whistle the deer head was visible from afar and he should keep it at that height.
  Being the decoy fell on Tye because the boy had the truer aim. The elder hunters had decided upon this themselves during target practice. Tye did not resent that it was not his part to slay the deer when hunting with his friend. He knew someday his chance would come.
  As they waited the boy adjusted the tension on his bow strings and absent-mindedly rolled the arrows on the ground at his feet. Today was a good day to hunt. The sky was clear and blue. There had been thunderstorms the previous week, which had made it tougher to meet their weekly quota, but with hard work the hunters had still reached the goal. Things were going well.
  At the sound of rustling in the bushes near the creek the boy immediately refocused and notched an arrow into his bow and drew into position. His breathing became measured and calm. Soon there was more movement, the sounds of a twig snapping, and then  a buck and doe appeared together at the edge of the creek. Slowly they drank from the cool waters and though the decoy was plainly visible to them, they did not seem to notice it. That was good. It gave the boy more time to choose the best shot.
  He raised up on his haunches so that his eyeline was level with the top of the grass. The two deer were not in the best position for a kill. The boy needed them to face east in order to expose their vulnerable side. Because they were so close by the boy could not risk moving even one inch from his spot. The deer were attuned to the sound of any predators, and that included him. Any sound at this point would give him away.
  After a few minutes of nothing his feet tingled from the lack of blood flow. His bow wavered slightly from its mark. Across the clearing he saw the head of the decoy lower and raise again in an unrealistic manner and hoped Tye had enough strength to hold steady.
  Then the deer ambled further down the creekside. And soon they were broadside to the boy. He let his arrow fly and it struck the buck just behind his foreleg with a thwomp. Both deer immediately sprung away without a break in stride, the arrow buried deep and blood letting out. In the same breath the boy prepared another shot. He wanted to get that doe before it was out of range. He drew an arrow and let it fly without hesitation, but it was a poor shot and went wide. But then Tye rose from his spot, in perfect position. He tossed the decoy from his arm and drew aim and let his arrow fly. He struck the doe mid-stride and it fell hard onto the ground at the forest edge.
  “Woohoo!” his friend shouted.
  The boy stood up and beamed at his friend. They then collected their gear and went to place where the doe had fallen. Tye reached his kill and said a prayer over it, asking for forgiveness and to thank her for gift she had bestowed. Together they set to work and field dressed it. With knives they opened and gutted her and then stretched out the body upright against a small tree, so the blood could drain. Tye tossed the entrails into the grass.
  Then they tracked the blood trail which led them to the buck. An hour later they found him dead in some brush. They dressed him out on the spot and lashed him to a travois and headed back to pick up the doe, and then to camp.
  By now it was afternoon and they were hungry. They pulled some pemmican from their bags and ate near the creek, dipping their canteens into the water for drink. Because they had tracked all morning they were famished and the food tasted good and they could feel it replenish their energy. While they ate they talked about the hunt and their good fortune. With the doe and buck this would put them ahead of quota for the week and would please the elders.
  “I never saw somebody go from decoy to killshot with such speed,” the boy said, praising his friend.
  Tye downplayed the compliment but his pride was evident.
  “It took the both of us,” he countered, “Your shot at the buck set me up. All I had to do was aim and shoot.”
  The boy smirked.
  “All you had to do.”
  They both laughed, and finished their meal. After, they refilled the canteens and took hold of the travois and began the long and arduous path back to camp.
  It was twilight before they were in sight of the camp, the firelight and smoke visible in the distance. They were joined on the path by other groups of hunters returning. Once again it seemed they had the best luck of the day. Entering the camp they were greeting by a group of girls who were in the act of salting meat from the previous day. They giggled and pointed to the hunters, too shy to speak. Helpers came out when they reached the center of the camp. They unlashed the kills from the travois and hauled them off to start the processing.
  There was a large fire where the hunters gathered every evening to discuss the work of the day over roasted meat and vegetables that had been collected. Some laid on their backs resting. Others sat on logs napping arrowheads or sharpening their knives for the following day. All were in a cheerful mood.
  He and Tye were received like heroes, even among their peers. They fed themselves and sat around the fire with the others. Word had already got around about their kills. Tye stood and retold the story, exagerrating only in places. He described the decoy, the creek, where Mika was crouched in the grass, and from which direction the deer had come. They were all impressed.
  At some point three of the elder huntsmen emerged from their tent and came over to the congratulate them. They placed their hands on the boy’s shoulder.
  “Here is Mika. The boy with the bow. You have made us proud today!”
  “It was Tye also,” the boy corrected, “He killed the doe himself.”
  They beamed and nodded to his friend.
  “Well then, you have both made us proud, and one day you will be warriors. This we know.”
  They stood the hunters and took them around the arms and shook them in the gesture of great respect. Then they addressed the group and told everyone to get plenty of rest. Since they had met quota for the week, the following morning they would be returning to the village for a few days of rest. The hunters cheered and that night they slept well from exhaustion and dreamt not the of the hunt but of home and being reunited with their loved ones.
