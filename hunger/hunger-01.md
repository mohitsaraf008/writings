HUNGER - Daniel Stepp

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver who had roused him from his slumber only moments before. Though it was springtime the night air was sharply cold and because she had given him no time to dress all he had on was his loincloth, leggings, and mocassins - bare from the waist up. For warmth he wrapped both arms around his chest and tucked his hands into his armpits. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they walked down the torchlit pathway he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. A fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills and obscured the small houses on either side of the path where they walked. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her hair where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. He entered alone.
  Yaholo, a pupil of the medicine man, stood over a fire in the center of the room. Smoke from it escaped through a small hole in the ceiling. In one hand he carried an dried eagleâ€™s claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs in to the flame, which sparked and hissed, and spoke the words of the death ritual in a rhythmic chant. He eyes gazed upon a faraway place and did not acknowledge the presence of any others in the room.
  Ama, his mother, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her breast, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the house.

  I love you.
