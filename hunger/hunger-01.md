HUNGER

When I was a child this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were children

  Mika followed the elderly caregiver who had roused him from his slumber only moments before. Though it was springtime the night air was sharply cold and because she had given him no time to dress all he had on was his loincloth, leggings, and mocassins. Bare from the waist up he wrapped both arms around him and tucked his hands into his armpits for warmth. The boy had yet to shake off his dreams and as they walked down the torchlit pathway he saw things that would not be out of place inside of one. A fog had rolled in from the surrounding hills and obscured the small houses on either side of the path where they walked. All he could see was a gray void and the faint silhouette of his guide in front of him. His eyes were drawn to the back of her hair where double-braided ends twisted around her neck like two snakes entwined. Over her shoulders she wore a heavy, bearskin shawl.
  Soon they came to a small house at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The house on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. The old woman parted the deerskin covering the low, narrow doorway and then stood aside in complete silence, her head bowed. The boy entered alone.
  Yaholo, an apprentice of the medicine man, stood over a firepit in the center of the house. Smoke from the fire curled up through a hole in the roof and its flames flickered shadows across the clay-hardened ceiling and walls. In one hand the apprentice carried an eagle’s claw wrapped around a buckskin pouch of herbs. He shook the herbs into the fire, which sparked and hissed, as he chanted the words of the death ritual. His eyes gazed upon a faraway place.
  Ama, his mother, stood in the corner furthest from the ceremony with both hands clasped against her chest, her eyes fearful and red with tears. When she saw her son her frown turned into a compassionate smile and her eyes went to the bed at the other end of the room. There his father lay. 
  Sakima, the revered medicine man of their village, lay upon a meager bed, wrapped in skins. He lay utterly still except for the gasps for air that came after long and irregular intervals. His eyes were rolled back in his head and sweat covered him.
  No one had instructed the boy what to do or how he should act in this moment. He glanced at his mother for guidance but her eyes were fixed on him who he had been brought to see. He went to the bed and took his hand into his own.
  “Father,” the boy said, kneeling beside him, tears welling in his eyes.
  He said nothing else, holding his hand, inwardly recoiling at the unnatural coldness of his touch. Such coldness in a room with embers burning hot. Feeling helpless, the boy went to a table near the wall and poured a cup of water from a jar. He brought the cup to his father’s mouth and gently fed it to him, and when the first drops wet the lips he came around again. His eyes opened. And then he recognized his son standing there. A tear rolled down the side of his cheek and he took the smaller hand of his son into his own, and squeezed weakly.
  “Beautiful boy,” the old man said, “come and see.”
  The boy leaned forward and placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the bitter salve, medicine applied to ease his suffering. He felt his heart beating, rapid and then slow, strong and then weak. At last he could feel the body heat, the life which remained in the body of his father. The boy stayed that way for a long time. They did not speak. He knew his father only wanted to feel close to him.
  Then underneath the table along the wall the boy saw a brown chicken pecking for seeds in the corner, oblivious to all else in the room. Concerned only with its own mindless existence. Pecking in the dirt while his father lay dying. He watched it for awhile and grew angry at it being there. At those stupid black eyes watching all.
  Then his father whispered into his ear and everything he could see instantly dimmed and everything he could hear, except for the words, instantly grew silent. Sakima asked something of him, a secret will. The act of speaking weakened the old man and when finished he collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and stared at his father, unsure if he had understood what had been asked of him. How like a dream it all was. He glanced to his mother in the corner and saw her pain, biting her fingers. He went to console her.
  Yaholo then approached the sick man and the monotone of his chants grew suddenly in volume. He pulled a baton of soapstone from his medicine bag and shook it overhead. From the corner the mother and son watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He appeared to be in great pain and jerked from one side of the bed to the other with unnatural strength.
  Then the boy saw the chicken under the table pecking in the dirt and became enraged. He darted towards it with hands outstretched but it was too fast and he fell against the table and knocked the pitcher onto the ground, where it shattered and spilled water everywhere. At this sound his father let out a scream unlike anything he had ever heard.
  Sakima was awake. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and shouted in anger at Yaholo, standing there with the baton. Tears came into his apprentice’s eyes yet he continued to utter the chants of the ritual. Then he glanced at his son. His eyes were wild and fearful and the boy did not recognize him from the loving memory he had of him.
  “Do what I ask of you.”
  Then he collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later became silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had been when the boy first entered the house.
  He looked at his unconscious father and then at the chicken still pecking in the dirt and could take no more. He ran outside  into the fog, unsure of where he was going. He ran for minutes while groping ahead for something familiar to him. And finally he reached a place he recognized and stopped. 
  At the base of the tree which was planted in the middle of the ceremonial grounds. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It’s bark was petrified, smooth and stone-like. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. It was sacred to the village. The boy had climbed on its limbs ever since he was able to and asked his father questions about it, what kind it was, how old, and when it was last alive. “Nobody knows,” his father had replied with patience, “It is a true mystery and therefore a gift to all.” The boy wondered at that and used to imagine the strange creatures which must have inhabited the earth when it lived and had perhaps been nourished by its leaves.
  Now it was the darkest time of night. The fog had dissipated and stars were visible in the sky. The moon was low. The morning was yet to come. He fell asleep against the trunk, shivering and goosefleshed, and he did not dream. Later, after his father had passed from this world, his mother covered him with a blanket and brushed back his hair and kissed his forehead gently.

  For seven days the village mourned. For seven days they fasted. The worst of it came each morning when went outside and gazed upwards. There were skies of the deepest blue and clouds of the purest white. The calm breeze. How at odds to the thunderstorms and darkened vistas he felt inside. He hated every beautiful thing. He spent those days weeping and beating on his chest until it was bruised. Together he sat with his mother and her sister outside their homestead. The women expressed their sorrow in an endless chant where they repeated the name of the departed until they ran out of breath. His nephews and cousins covered themselves in ashes and sliced their fingertips with sharp pieces of flint. Other neighbors wailed in their homes. All were forbidden to laugh or smile or even to speak a light word during this period.
  When it was over the boy looked out of the window. He saw people going back and forth, some his friends, carrying materials for building and baskets of food. His heart was still low, as if it had no bottom. As the son of the departed he was not required to participate in the work going on for the funeral rites, but he felt like it might do him good to put his body and mind to use in some way. So he went outside and headed to the ceremonial grounds with the others.
  A platform constructed from reeds was being raised in the center of the grounds, near the trunk of the great tree and the high mound upon which rested the council house, where the chief resided. The boy set immediately to work lashing together the platform with strips of buckskin. If any of the others noticed him as the son of the departed they did not say so. They treated him like any other and that was the way he liked it.
  The remainder of the day he helped with the preparations. By now the sun was going down and shined through the treetops on the hillside to the west. The boy was covered with dirt and his arms and back ached from the labor of the day. He sat and watched the women set up tables near the platform and then dishes of all kinds were brought out and arranged upon them. Roasted deer meat, pork, rabbit and other game were at the center. Then surrounding those steaming dishes were bowls filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and his favorite, kanuchi soup, which is made from hickory nuts.
  Families from the surrounding valley were starting to arrive, dressed in their best, most colorful clothes. He saw his own family arrive from the other side of the village, Ama and her sister Ayita with her husband and two boys. When his mother saw him she looked disapprovingly at his soiled clothes and dirty face and spit on her hand to wipe him clean.
  “Go prepare yourself!”
  By the time he returned it was evening. He walked among the crowds who were eating and drinking. The boy was not hungry himself. He remained out of sight of his family who had a central place on a bench near the base of the tree. He found a hidden spot away from the crowds and sat on the grass to watch from there. His heart was low and he wanted to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the tree whose shadowed branches spiraled towards the muted skies. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him.
  Then suddenly he remembered the last words his father had spoken to him, on his deathbed with the chicken pecking in the dirt. He had not thought of it once since that night. Now it returned and somehow he knew that he would never forget them. Maybe tonight he would share them with the people of the village. Maybe they could tell him of their significance. Or maybe not. Maybe the ghost of his father would visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant himself, why it was so important that he do what had been asked of him. But such things did not really happen, he knew that. Only in stories did they happen.
  At last the elders emerged from the council house and descended into the ceremonial grounds. There were five of them total and they were dressed in magnificent garb. The most delicate deerskins covered in beads and feathers. Their faces were painted red and white. Kulsathee, the old chief of peace, led them with a solemn frown. When they reached the benches at the foot of the tree they turned to face the people gathered. But their gaze was fixed on the two men who approached the funeral platform with the body of the departed medicine man.
  When the boy saw the body of Sakima, who had been anointed with oils and covered in dark paint, then dressed in a ritual gown, nothing like what he normally wore, he wept. The bearers reached the platform and lifted the body onto it. Then a group of them together lifted the platform onto the tall legs, where it fit into slots. They brought all of his belongings out and laid them at the base of the platform. Wood was brought and arranged for the burning. Another young man carried the tinder close to the pyramid of kindling and fuel wood and used a block of flint to start the fire. It caught quickly and within minutes the entire platform was engulfed in flames, an bright orange glow cast onto the tearful faces of the people who had loved him most.
  So bright it burned that even the boy was no longer completely hidden in the shadows of the evening. He watched the flames consume the old medicine man. Plumes of dark smoke and flecks of embered ash rolled into the air above them. He turned to the crowd and there among them he saw a pair of eyes staring back at him. His friend Tye, who was a hunter like himself, and therefore trained to see things that wanted to remain out of sight. Tye was savvy. He would respect his wishes and not approach his friend in mourning. Instead he made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, this was a secret  symbol of their friendship. The boy returned the gesture from his spot in the darkness. His true friend.
  Yet someone else had discovered him there in the flickering light of the funeral pyre, approaching him from the side so as not to be detected. She emerged carrying food. The light from the fire was reflected in her eyes and her long, braided hair shimmered, smooth and flowing like a dark river. Leoti was beautiful indeed. She placed a bowl of kanuchi on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. He gazed upon her and then at the bowl, steam rising from it in the cool air.
  “Eat, Mika.”
  “I am not hungry.”
  But he knew it was not a request, and that she would not leave him be until he ate, so he picked up the bowl and drank the soup down with only a few gulps. It was good, rich and sweet. Leoti then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. It was still warm and the grease seeped through the wrappings.
  “Eat.”
  He ate the bread and meat too and then invited her to sit next to him. She did so. He noticed she did not try to console him though he saw the pity in her expression. Slowly his mood changed as the food restored his energy. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how truly hungry he was. They sat together while the fire burned. He was happy she was here. Now when he looked at the people gathered in the ceremonial grounds he saw them differently. He saw that it was love that had brought them together and that was not something to take for granted. He felt that love himself and no longer wanted to be alone. He took Leoti by the hand and led them both to the place where his family sat. Ama’s eyes widened when she saw her son and hugged and kissed him.
  As the evening went on the family was greeted by everyone who came. This was the rite of consolation. Then when it was late and the fire had burned low the people came closer and they took turns telling stories about the old medicine man. Each story surprised him as it was like they were talking about someone other than his father. 
  At last Kulsathee frose from his spot in the circle of elders. He was a large, rotund man with long graying hair. He was the chief of peace and had been the leader of their tribe ever since before the boy was born. There were deep lines in his face and whenever he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather. His eyes were red and cheeks were wet from many tears.
  “All the old things are gone now and the people are different.  When we were boys Sakima and I roamed these forests and hunted together. Even then he was drawn to the mysteries of nature. He would commune with the spirit of the trees to reveal where the rabbits were hidden. We caught so many! I loved Sakima, whom you all knew, from the time we were both young and had our entire lives in ahead of us. But all the old things are gone now and the people are different. He was my good friend and I will miss him.”
  It was then, in the lull between speakers, that the boy felt compelled to rise and tell them all what his father had said to him on his deathbed. He rose and approached the center of the circle near the remnants of the bonfire whose embers still glowed and gave off heat. Nobody said anything when they saw him approach. Kulsathee walked up to him and held both of his arms in the gesture of great kinship and then returned to his seat with the elders.
  Moments passed. The boy looked into the crowd and saw their hopeful and expectant faces. He knew they wanted to hear something about the beloved Sakima. To inspire them and to assure them that it was no tragedy for a great man to die. He saw their sadness and wanted to tell them something that could heal the broken hearts. Yet he did not speak. Only now that the moment had come was it clear to him that the words spoken to him were not for them. They were not for them to hear. No, they must be shown. Further, it would be a betrayal to the memory of his father to utter the words to those whom it had not been given. He was embarrassed at the ignorance of his gesture. The people stirred and grew impatient. Some in the crowd put it down to youthful shyness. Some took it as pride on his part and wrinkled their noses. Some pitied him. Some said he was not the man his father was.
