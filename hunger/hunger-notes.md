Outline:

1) The boy taken to the bedside of his dying father who whispers to him alone
   to water the old, dead tree each day. From the source, high on the mountain to
   the East. His father dies before he agrees to do it.
2) The funeral feast where all the people mourn the passing of the great shaman, 'His 
   memory shall live in our hearts forever'.
3) The boy plays ball with his friends but sees the tree and is reminded of his 
   father's request. He sulks alone and his mother asks him what is the matter. 
   He tells her of the request and she says, then you must do it. But I want to 
   play with my friends. That is your decision to make. I cannot force you.
4) The next day he takes the bucket and attempt to walk to the mountain but gets 
   lost and turns around and fills the bucket with water from the nearby stream 
   instead. He tells his mother he watered it and she says, 'Aren't you happy to 
   have honored your father's memory?' But that night his view of the stars so 
   bright in the heavens were obscured by tears.
5) In the night there came a storm and lightning struck the storage building and 
   it burns to the ground. There is a growing panic because the entire village 
   relies on those stores to make it through the winter. There is not enough. 
   The prices of the existing corn rose and rose until only the wealthiest could 
   afford them. The boy returns to his mother to give her the bad news. She cries. 
   He consoles her and once again thinks of the bucket and how he has neglected the tree.
6) There is a gathering around the tree the following morning. All the able men of the village 
   will report for hunting duties. The women must gather and fish.
7) His mother tells him to forget his father's request. The boy reports and they 
   go into the valley to hunt buffalo and elk with arrows and by other means. He 
   makes a kill and is lifted onto the shoulders of the other boys. He is a hero. 
   His mother tells him how proud she is. But all he could think about was the empty 
   bucket in the corner.
8) They join with another tribe who are hunting also. They combine and the village 
   grows. His best friend becomes the hero. He is made the leader. They cut down 
   the tree in order to carve a statue in his honor.
9) A plague breaks out in the village and contaminates the meat. There are too many 
   people and they begin to fight. Eventually they begin to eat the fallen. They set 
   fire to the tree.
10) A blizzard comes. The boy walks blind but he knows the way without his eyes and delivers 
    the water to the charred remains of the tree and collapses against it, cold, tired.
11) In the morning the villagers awake and find that the tree has blossomed and is filled with
    bright fruit, the flesh yellow and sweet and nourishing. It leaves green and verdant in 
    contrast to the dead winter landscape.

   He was filled with restlessness and there was a hole inside him that made it 
   unbearable to even look at the others. What was he doing out here? They inside 
   warm in their blankets.

   But I am not strong. I am weak and miserable. Not brave. Please don't use those words.
   They hurt me because I know they are not true. How hungry I am. Every night I dream of meat 
   roasting on the fire. But even more than hungry I am lonely out here. I am so lonely for 
   companionship. Of any kind. I made a friend of a marmot. He accompanies me. I miss you, 
   mama. I miss my friends. I miss how life was before. Those happy times will never come again, 
   that is for sure. Will they come again?

   I am worse. I am low. My heart feels as if it has no bottom. I don't care about 
   the tree. I don't care about my father's request. I only do this now because it's 
   all that I can do. He gestured to the glow from the wigwams. Look at what they have. 
   Girlfriends to cuddle next to the fire with. I want those things too, mama. You see? 
   I am not more pure than them. It makes me pathetic. They are right to mock me and 
   to scorn me like they do.

   They will, she assured him, though she did not believe it herself. Do not lose hope, 
   my son. Do not despair.

   She wept for him and comforted him but the thing that had been asked of him by 
   his father had not been asked of her and therefore she could not join him in the wilds. 
   She prayed for him and told him she would help as she could and returned to the 
   village house. He understood this and was not resentful.

   "We shall not starve."
