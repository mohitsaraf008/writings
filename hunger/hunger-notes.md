Tone of Dignity but not Dry, think Job

Outline

   Spring

*) The boy taken to the bedside of his dying father who whispers to him alone
   to water the old, dead tree each day. From the source, a lake on the mountain 
   to the East. His father dies before he agrees to do it.
*) The funeral feast where all the people mourn the passing of the great shaman, 'His 
   memory shall live in our hearts forever'.
*) The boy plays ball with his friends but sees the tree and is reminded of his 
   father's request. He sulks alone and his mother asks him what is the matter. 
   He tells her of the request and says he can no longer enjoy the games like he 
   did before. But I want to play with my friends. That is your decision to make. 
*) The next day he takes the bucket and attempt to walk to the mountain but gets 
   lost and turns around and fills the bucket with water from the nearby stream 
   instead. He tells his mother he watered it and she says, 'Aren't you happy to 
   have honored your father's memory?' But that night his view of the stars so 
   bright in the heavens were obscured by his tears.
*) In the night there comes a powerful storm and lightning strikes the storage building 
   and burns it to the ground. There is a growing panic because the entire village 
   relies on those stores to make it through the winter. There is not enough. 
   The prices of the existing corn rose and rose until only the wealthiest could 
   afford them. The boy returns to his mother to give her the bad news. She cries. 

   Summer

*) There is a gathering around the tree the following morning. All the able men 
   of the village will report for hunting duties. The women must gather and fish.
*) His mother tells him to forget his father's request. The boy reports and they 
   go into the valley to hunt buffalo and elk with arrows and by other means. He 
   makes a kill alongside his best friend Niko (he was always better than him with 
   the bow) and is lifted onto the shoulders of the other boys. He is a hero. 
   His mother tells him how proud she is. But all he could think about was the 
   empty bucket in the corner.
*) The next day Mika does not go to the hunt. Instead he takes the bucket and 
   follows the river and hours later reaches the lake on the mountain. He returns 
   with tired legs and arms and pours the water at the base of the tree. Nothing 
   happens. Silence all around. Later the hunters return with their kill and ask 
   where he was. Fufilling a request from my father he said. They nod but he could 
   see they did not understand what he said.

   Autumn

*) Weeks go by. The boy walks everyday. And everyday the people of the village 
   resent him more and more. They tell him he and his mother cannot partake of the 
   food if he does not join in. His mother tells him to abandon the deed, his father 
   was feverish when he told him. Not in his right mind. His friends mock him and 
   ridicule the bucket he carries. He grows thin. So he returns to the hunt.
*) They accept him back. He eats and kills but always there is the bucket at the end 
   of the day, empty. So he tries to do both and fails. Then he abandons the hunt 
   completely. Finally they condemn him for not taking care of his mother. She 
   goes to live with their cousin and he is told not to stay in the inner encampment. 
   So he goes to the wilds and sleeps on the ground.
*) The hunters fight with another tribe who are hunting in the valley also. They 
   triumph and Niko approaches them with an agreement to combine their forces. The 
   village grows by orders of magnitude. His best friend becomes the new leader, ousting 
   the old Sakima, who is not of the new order. They cut down the tree in order to 
   carve a statue in his honor. Mika wept when he saw what they had done to the tree.

   Winter

*) His mother visits him in the wilds and he cries to her. 
*) The number of people now living in the small space contaminates the water supply 
   and plague breaks out in the village and spoils the food stores. There are too many 
   people and they begin to fight. Eventually they begin to eat the dead. They set 
   fire to the tree and it mostly burns. Only a charred trunk and a few limbs remain.
*) The first blizzard of winter comes. The boy walks blind but he knows the way without 
   his eyes and delivers the water to the remains of the tree and collapses against 
   it, cold and alone, his extremeties numb.
*) In the morning the villagers awake and find that the tree has blossomed and is filled with
   bright fruit, the flesh yellow and sweet and nourishing. Its leaves verdant against 
   the mute and colorless landscape, a true paradox.



   He was filled with restlessness and there was a hole inside him that made it 
   unbearable to even look at the others. What was he doing out here? They inside 
   warm in their blankets.

   But I am not strong. I am weak and miserable. Not brave. Please don't use those words.
   They hurt me because I know they are not true. How hungry I am. Every night I dream of meat 
   roasting on the fire. But even more than hungry I am lonely out here. I am so lonely for 
   companionship. Of any kind. I made a friend of a marmot. He accompanies me. I miss you, 
   mama. I miss my friends. I miss how life was before. Those happy times will never come again, 
   that is for sure. Will they come again?

   They will, she assured him, though she did not believe it herself. Do not lose hope, 
   my son. Do not despair.

   I am worse than all of them. I am low. My heart feels as if it has no bottom. I 
   don't care about the tree. I don't care about this burden. I only do it because 
   it's all that I can do anymore. He gestured to the glow from the wigwams. 
   Look at what they have. Warm fire, food to eat. Joking and laughing together. 
   Girlfriends to cuddle next to the fire with. Do you want to know a secret? I 
   crave those things too. You see? I am sick with envy. I am not more holy than 
   they. I am not pure. How pathetic I am. They are right to mock me and to scorn 
   me like they do.

   "Over here, the boy with the bucket!"

   She wept for him and comforted him but the thing that had been asked of him had 
   not been asked of her and therefore Mika knew she would not join him in the wilds. 
   She prayed to the Great Spirit for strength on his behalf and told him she would 
   help as best she could and then returned to the village. Mika watched his mother 
   go in silence. He loved her very much.

   "My boy is gone forever, my beautiful Mika."

   Then the remaining members of the village joined together in a song, and a joyful 
   song it was, because of what Mika had done for them after all, because they would 
   not starve.

   "We shall not starve."
