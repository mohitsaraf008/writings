HUNGER
by Daniel Stepp


I.

The boy was led to the wigwam at the far end of a small hamlet that made up the 
shaman's area of the village. Here there were three wigwams altogether. The one on 
the end was where they took those with life-threatening hunting injuries or for 
illnesses that had no cure. The boy's father was the shaman of the village and 
normally would have been performing the ritual tonight but since it was he who 
was sick the rites were being performed by his apprentice, an older man who did 
not have much gift for the work but was competent and always did his best.
