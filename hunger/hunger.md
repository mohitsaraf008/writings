HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


Mika was led to a tiny mud house at the far end of a hamlet of buildings that made 
up the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with 
fatal hunting injuries or for illnesses that had no cure. Mika's father was the shaman 
and would have been performing the ritual tonight if it were not him who was on his 
deathbed. Instead the rites were being performed by his pupil Yaholo, a man of middle-age 
paunch who did not have much talent for the role but was well-liked anyway because he 
never pretended to be more than he was.

From the low, crescent-shaped moon in the Eastern sky the boy knew it was morning 
and yet still hours before the sunrise. He walked in a twilight of consciousness 
from being roused so abruptly only moments before.

But his father was no longer there. It was only a body.
