HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A new moon hung low among the stars to the East. Mika saw its crescent shape behind the trees of the forest and knew it must be morning and yet hours before sunrise. The boy followed behind an old woman who had roused him from slumber only moments before. He had yet to shake off his dreams. He observed his surroundings and thought how unreal it all was. His cold breath in the air. The quiet along the village pathways. The stony frowns on the faces of the elders, all dressed in their ceremonial beadwork. The slow chanting of the girls, some his friends, who wore turtle-shell rattles on their arms and legs. Their eyes gazed at a faraway place that nobody else could see. Soon they came to a small mud hut at the end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The hut on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. His father was the shaman of the village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay inside.

Mika's guide parted the deerskin cover that hung over the door and stood aside and joined the girls in their chanting. The boy entered alone.

Yaholo was there, a pupil of the shaman. He stood over the embers in the center of the room and muttered the ancient words of the ritual. His mother Ama stood in the corner farthest from the ceremony and watched Mika with an expression of pity. Her hands were clasped against her chest. And on a bed woven from reed was his father Sakima.

No one had told him what to do once inside, but he approached his father and placed his hand upon his. The skin was dry and cold. This surprised him since it was so hot in the house, the coals in the pit giving off so much light and head he could feel sweat beading on his back. Sakima was not conscious. His eyes rolled back in his head. He turned from one side to the other. He was in great pain.

Mika turned to Yaholo and made eye contact with him. But Yaholo looked through him. He also gazed upon the faraway place.

There was a jar of water on a table and Mika poured some into his hand and fed it to his father. When the moisture hit Sakima's lips he came around and recognized his son. There were tears in his eyes. He took the smaller hands of his son into his and squeezed them.

Son, his father said, come to me.

Mika placed his head against his father's chest and smelled a bitter salve. He looked towards the ceiling and saw the shadows of Yaholo's movements dance across the ceiling plaster. Then in the corner, underneath a bench, he saw a chicken perched. Oblivious to what was going on. Mika grew angry at it being there. What place did it have here? Its stupid black eyes watching all.

Then his father Sakima whispered something into his ear and Mika forgot the chicken and everything else in the hut. There were only the words and the sick, foul breath in his ear. Sakima asked something of him, his will. And when there was nothing more to say the old man collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had heard right. Then he looked at his mother in the corner. Her eyes were wet with tears. He went to console her.

Yaholo approached Sakima and suddenly his voice grew in volume. He pulled a baton decorated in green soapstone and shook it rhythmically over the sick man. From the corner of the building Mika and his mother watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He was in great pain. Mika left to tend to him but his mother pulled him back. He saw the stupid chicken under the bench now pecking at the dirt and this filled Mika with rage. He escaped his mother's embrace and chase it outside but then his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard from him.

He was awake again. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and yelled in anger at Yaholo. Tears came to his pupil's eyes but he continued to speak the words of the ceremony. Then Sakima looked at his son. His eyes were wild. There was fear in them.

Will you?

All turned to Mika as his father asked him this question repeatedly. Mika did not answer. Then Sakima collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had when Mika had first entered the hut. And when the boy saw the chicken again next to the bed he could take no more of it and ran outside.

The air outside was cool. The others stood in silence and looked to Mika in order to know what was going on. He ignored them and ran to the center of the village, a clearing one acre square, the ceremonial ground where many times he and his father had sat together.

In the middle of the ceremonial ground was an old tree. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It bark was smooth and stone-like. The tree was sacred to the village. Its symbol in fact. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. Mika had climbed on its limbs since he was a boy and had always asked his father questions about it, how old it was, where it had come from, and his father had always answered that nobody knew. Mika used to imagine the strange creatures who must have inhabited the world when it lived and who were perhaps nourished by its leaves.

Now he sat at the base of the tree alone. It was the darkest time of night. The stars were gone. The morning yet to come. He remembered times he shared with his father under the tree and soon fell asleep. Later, after the shaman had passed from this world into the next, his mother found him there shivering and wrapped a blanket around him.

~

Then there was a festive gathering. It was known among the clans of the southern valleys as the *Celebration of the Dead*. A large bonfire was kindled on the ceremonial grounds and every kind of food was prepared. Families from all over the surrounding hills were invited to pay their respects to the great Sakima, but also to enjoy the good food and the company of their neighbors.

A high platform constructed from reed was raised within the ceremonial grounds and the beloved shaman was placed upon it. His body was anointed with strongly-scented oils and adorned with the beadwork he wore throughout his lifetime. The platform where he rested stood six feet off the ground and some of the children dared one another to climb up the sides to have a peek but when the parents saw what they were doing they scolded them harshly and reminded them to show respect. The young women arranged flower sashes all about the base of the platform. Here the shaman would lie until the elders decided it was time to bury him in the ground. It was the same for every great man.

Roasting spits were planted near the bonfire and skewered with deer, pigs, rabbits and other game. Long tables were brought out and set upon them were clay bowls and pots filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and *kanuchi*, which is a soup made from hickory nuts. All the families of the village brought something and all were welcome to partake. Gathered they numbered in the hundreds.

Mika walked among them. He was alone and tried to stay invisible, though it was hard. He did not like to be consoled for the loss of his father. He did not like to be reminded what a great man Sakima was. He even avoided his mother because of the way she now looked at him. Those sad eyes, filled with pity, he could not stand it.

He found a hidden spot, away from the crowd, and sat upon a log there to watch them. They were kind people who meant well. He did not resent them. He wanted only to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the ancient tree in the shadow of the bonfire flames. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. 

Then Mika recalled the last words his father had spoken to him and wondered what they could mean. He wished the ghost of his father would visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant and what to do about them. Why he must do that particular thing. But he knew such things did not happen. Only in stories did they happen.

At the edge of the bonfire flames he spotted his friend Tye. He  longed to run up to his friend and joke like they always did yet he knew it was not appropriate here. Tye was a hunter like Mika and it did not take him long to spot his friend hidden in the darkness. Tye was savvy and did not approach his friend in mourning. Instead he made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, a secret symbol of their friendship. Mika returned the gesture from his spot on the log. His true friend.

Yet someone else had discovered him there in the shadows of the bonfire light and approached him from behind, in secret. Leoti emerged carrying a small bowl of food. Her hair was braided and hung gracefully over the shoulder. She was beautiful indeed. The last time Mika had seen her was the night his father died. She was part of the group of girls who chanted with the turtle shell rattles outside the house. Leoti placed the bowl on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. Mika gazed upon her and then glanced at the bowl, steam rising from it.

You must eat, she said.

He picked up the bowl and drank the soup down with only a few gulps. Kanuchi was one of his favorites. She then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. Still warm and grease seeping through the material.

Eat, Mika.

He noticed she did not try to console him though he could see the pity in her eyes. He unraveled the cloth and ate. His mood changed as the food restored energy to his body. The meat was good. The bread was good too. He had not realized how hungry he was.

Thank you, Leoti.

She smiled and they sat together for awhile. Mika was happy she was here. He looked at all the people and for the first time that evening understood that it was love that had brought them together and that it was something not to take for granted. And he felt it himself and no longer wanted to be alone.

The elders of the tribe then gathered around the fire and the people gathered around them and sat on the ground. Mika and Leoti came closer and found a place next to the others. Then, in turn, each of the village elders told stories about Sakima the shaman. As he listened Mika was filled with such pride at the things they said. Half of the stories he had never heard before.

At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the center of the group of elders, a large rotund man the same age as his father. He was what they called the *Chief of Peace* and had been the leader of the tribe ever since before Mika was born. There were deep lines in his face and when he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather.

The old Kulsathee told a story of how he and Sakima were out hunting one day, far away from the village, when they were just boys. Far away, he repeated. Many weeks. They were hunting bison  in the plains and decided to explore the valleys of the Southern Mountains. He spread his arms around him. 

These green valleys, he said. How we loved them. We found deer and pigs, squirrels and turkey. And then my good friend, Sakima the brave, he took a walk by himself one morning in a dense fog and discovered our tree by accident. Kulsathee gestured toward its dead, ancient branches and everyone looked at it.

Sakima discovered the tree and had a vision on that misty morning. He foresaw that our people would establish a village here on this same spot. So we returned and told the elders what we had found and about the vision Sakima had been given. But the elders laughed at Sakima and called him just a boy. The next year was the bloody war among the plains people and we were uprooted, our homes burned, our crops destroyed. We traveled here as it seemed a safe haven from the death and desolation of the plains. From that point on his visions were respected and he became shaman.

The old *Chief of Peace* continued to tell stories of Sakima well into the morning. He told of the establishment of the tribe in the hills around. He told of the first council that united the neighboring tribes together. And when he was done there were tears in his eyes and the people watching were amazed as they had never seen him show emotion as he did that night.

It was then, in the lull between speakers, that Mika felt compelled to rise and tell the crowd about what his father had said to him just before his death. He rose and approached the center of the circle near the flames of the bonfire. No one said anything when they saw him approach. Kulsathee walked up to the young boy and held both of his arms in the gesture of great kinship, and then sat down with the others.

Mika stood before the people with his head bowed. Moments went by in complete silence as he collected his thoughts. Then he raised his head and observed them all. He looked into their eyes. Each one of them. They were expectant and hopeful. They wanted to hear something about his father, to inspire them. To let them know it was okay for a great man to die. Yet Mika did not speak. The words his father had spoken to him that night in the sweat house was not for them. What had been asked of him was not for them to know and that it would be a betrayal to the memory of his father to utter them to those whom it had not been given. He now understood.

The people stirred and wanted him to say something yet Mika remained silent. Some in the crowd laughed it off as youthful shyness. Some took it as pride on his part and wrinkled their noses in disgust before returning to see if there was anything good left to eat. Some pitied him. Some said he was not the man his father was.

Those were the days of abundance when the meadows in the valley turned green and blossomed with wildflowers and berries. A myriad of colors replaced the grays and browns of Winter. The river which ran through the village and irrigated their crops glistened in those mild afternoons. The women went daily along its banks and pulled trout from traps they built in the small cascades. Those fish they would barbecue that same evening to feed their families for supper. There was no need to salt them for storage during this time of the year.

The men hunted game in the nearby forests or busied themselves with construction that had been put off during the cold season. They fixed leaky roofs and erected summer shelters that allowed the breeze to blow through. This work they did communally from shared materials, harvested and stored in a building on the Northern side of the village. 

The young children ran in the fields and played games in the woods like hide and seek. They went shirtless and ate strawberries and blackberries until their mouths and fingers were stained purple. 

The older children collected in a wide open area on the Southern edge of the village grounds. There a field had been cleared of all shrubs and grass so that only a dirt floor remained. Over the years it had been hardened by the weather and by their footsteps. Here they played dice and ball games. Stick ball was popular when there were many in the group, but the game that required the most skill and therefore attracted the attention of even the elders was *tchungkee*. 

Tchungkee was a game for hunters since it required the use of a spear. There was a stone disc about the size of a grapefruit, polished smooth, with two concave indentations carved into opposite sides. This caused the disc to roll in unpredictable patterns. Two competitors lined up at the edge of a small arena whose boundaries were marked with rocks. The roller would stand between the boys and let out of a *yip* as he tossed the disc hard into the arena. The boys with the spears then had only a few seconds to gauge where they thought the disc would end up and throw their spears. Whoever threw nearest to the place where the disc ended up got the point.

This game was so popular the elders gathered under the shade of the trees that ran along the dirt arena. They brought their pipes and blankets and gambled with each other about who would win and by how many points. They all had their favorites but by far the most favored was Mika the son of Sakima, since he had the most steady throw and consistently scored more points than any of the other boys.

On this day they had already played for hours and Mika was indeed  ahead of the others in points, and yet not as much as usual, so much that some of the elders who regularly bet on his wide spread were now losing and whenever he looked over there he could see them frowning and waving their hands in frustration.

The reason for his unusually bad performance was that all afternoon his attention had been drawn to the distant Northern mountains that could be seen from here. They were not visible from within the village gates. It was only from here, in the arena clearing, that he could see those rocky ridges so far away. Once more Mika was reminded of the words of his father had spoken to him on his deathbed. He became distracted and threw his spear off the mark.

His opponent in this match, a poor player named Mohe, was excited and ran to the place his spear had landed and counted how many notches he was to the disc. Four two Mika’s seven. He had won by three points. Mika walked to his spear which stuck in the dirt a few feet from the disc. Mohe was thrilled by his score and shouted to the others to make sure everyone saw and that the scorekeeper had marked it down accurately.

Mika pulled his spear and walked to the side of the arena and sat down. His friend Tye approached.

The old men say your spear must be bad for you to be throwing like this. They say to me, Tye give him yours and he will win again.

Old buzzards, Mika said, don’t they have anything else to do? Like smoke their pipes or take cat naps.

They are worried about their bets, that’s all.

Tye looked towards the field and saw Mohe was trying to get the attention of a group of girls who sat in a circle under a tree, sewing bead necklaces. Leoti was among them. She glanced back towards Mika and Tye.

Mohe is fond of Leoti. Are you going to let that happen?

I don’t care.

His friend dropped his own spear in front of Mika.

Use mine. Challenge him again. I want to see the look on his face when you prove it was just bad luck.

Mika looked at his friend.

My spear is good. See for yourself.

Tye picked up the spear and examined it. He felt the leather straps and ran his hand along the spine, looking for imperfections.

He agreed. Your spear is good. No splinters. No warp. But how did you lose to Mohe?

I tell you my head is not right. I cannot stop thinking about my father.

His friend nodded. Tye’s brother had died in a hunting accident two summers ago so he understood loss.

It will get better, Tye said. He rose and clasped on hand on his friend’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes. You are the best tchungkee thrower of them all.

Tye left to join a game of dice across the field but then shouted over his shoulder, Except for me!

Mika grinned.

Soon another round of tchungkee started and Mohe took the lead in points since Mika did not feel like playing anymore. His friends were disappointed. The gambling elders gave up on him and placed their bets on Mohe instead. Mika watched the game from the sidelines for awhile longer then went to find his mother.

Ama was outside their summer house teaching a group of young girls how to flesh deer hides for tanning. She was old but still strong. When she scraped the broad flint blade across a hide draped along a flat wooden incline she moved like a woman twenty years younger than she was. The girls each took turns and were not nearly as quick and efficient as Ama, but they were learning and Mika’s mother was patient with them.

When she saw her son approach she wiped her hands on a cloth and embraced him. That look of pity she always gave him was present and though Mika still resented it he wanted her counsel.

Mama, I am sad.

Let us talk, his mother said. 

She told the girls to keep up the work and to finish the hide they were working on and then they could take a break. This renewed their enthusiasm.

Mika and Ama walked together along the road that led out of the village. The gates were open this time of year. From here they could hear the children playing in the arena, their laughter.

Why are you not in the arena with your friends?

I was there. I lost to Mohe.

Is that why you are sad?

No, mama.

Ama looked at him with understanding. Of course it isn’t. Now tell me what is wrong, my son.

Mika was upset to the point of tears. He wondered if he should tell his mother everything, her eyes so full of compassion. She wanted him to be happy. But he could not tell her. Not even her.

Father asked something of me, the night of his death, a thing I must do. So I tell myself Mika this thing can wait. There is time enough to do it later. But when I try to enjoy the things I did before it is there and there is no joy in those things anymore.

Mika stopped in the road and his mother did the same. He looked towards the far mountains partially hidden by the hills. His mother followed his eyes but did not speak or asked him why he looked there.

I want to play games with my friends again. I want it to be like it was before when life was fun and carefree. Now there is always the voice of my father. It pulls me away from them.

Ama reached out and feathered the hair that fell into Mika’s eyes. This show of tenderness caused a tear to fall and he was ashamed because that was not a thing men did.

Look at me, Mika.

He did so.

My son, your heart is now divided. You must do what it asks of you or you will have no peace. Do not be afraid. Your friends will wait for you. You will play games with them again. Like it was before, it will be again. But first you must find peace.

Is all that really true? Mika asked. His eyes welled with tears but he smiled with hope.

Yes it is true.

Mika and his mother embraced and then returned inside the gates of the village. The late afternoon sun shone through the gate poles and lit geometrical shapes onto the path where they walked. It was time for supper and in the air was an aroma of fresh barbecued fish and bread baking on the fire.

~

Before dawn Mika rose. He was careful not to wake his mother who slept next to him. In the darkness of morning he found his knife and the sheathe with a strap to go around his shoulder. Ama the night before had prepared some fried bread cakes, good food for travel, and wrapped them in a thin cloth. He put those in a satchel also strapped around his shoulder. There was no need to take any water as he would be following the river and could drink from it whenever he was thirsty.

There was an old bucket in the storage shed his father had used. Most of the contents of the shed were now dispersed to others in the tribe, but nobody had yet found a need for this bucket, and Mika was happy to find it there just as he remembered.

With these few items he stepped on the path that headed outside the Northern gate. His good friend Gawoni stood guard that morning and Mika found him snoring under the platform built for archers.

Let me out you lazy dog, Mika said. 

He gave his friend a soft kick in the side and Gawoni startled awake. Mika laughed.

Why do you laugh? Gawoni said. He stretched both arms above him and yawned like a mountain lion. I was awake the whole time.

Again Mika asked his friend to open the gate. Gawoni, when his eyes adjusted to the dim light of morning, gave Mika a strange look.

Where are you going so early in the morning?

To do what my father has asked of me.

But where?

To the mountains in the north.

Why must you do this thing?

He did not say. He only told me what to do.

What is the bucket for?

I cannot tell you. Please don't be angry.

Gawoni sighed. It was much too early for this so he swung open one of the wooden gates just enough for Mika to pass.

You are a strange one, Mika, that is for sure. Safe travels to you.

Mika walked outside and heard the gate shut behind him. He turned to see Gawoni returning to his napping spot under the platform.

So long, Gawoni.

Do me a favor and when you return make sure it is after sunrise.

Now that he was out here it was not so bad. The dirt path ended not too far away from the village and then there was just the river to guide him. But it was a fine guide. The directions clear. When the morning sun appeared over the hills it reflected off of the surface of the water and shined into his eyes. He shielded them and kept walking.

Once he left the valley he came to a wide plain. Here for the first time he had a clear view of the far mountains. The peaks of it were covered in snow.

But though he was away from the village, away from his friends and all the people that loved him, finally there was a calm inside him. He did not think of the words of his father now. He had no need to. 

The bucket he carried in his left hand started to blister the palms so he switched it to the right. But then after an hour it began to blister the right and he switched again. This time there was no avoiding the blisters and he knew when the skin broke because it was a sharp pain now.

His legs hurt. His back was sore. He rested in a field of tall grass. He went to the river bank and dunked his head under. The cold revitalized him. He cupped some water and drank it down. Then he sat in the grass and ate a few pieces of the fried bread. It nourished him.

That is enough progress for today, he said aloud.

He kindled a fire in the grass and watched the sun go down and the stars emerge in the heavens. So bright they were that night because it was the new moon. Then he lay in the grass and fell asleep almost immediately. He did not dream and did not open his eyes once until the morning sun rose over the horizon and illuminated the plains. He held one arm over his eyes to shield himself from the low sunrise. Its radiance warmed his skin and dried up the dew on the grass within the hour.

Mika had thought the nights rest would heal the soreness in his legs and back and make the blisters on his palms better. But it was worse today. He walked slower but made progress.

You are soft, Mika, he scolded himself, This deed is not for a boy but for a man. And you are no man.

He wrapped the handle of the bucket with blades of grass to make it softer but it helped little. They bled and the pain from them was nearly constant. He had to stop for rest more often on the second day. He ate more of the food. Indeed there was not much of it left, but that was no matter. When he stopped for the day he caught a fish in the river with some line he brought in the satchel and cooked it over the fire. Again he felt his strength return.

Three more days passed in the same way. The soreness did not get better but he did get better at living with it. Now in the distance he could see the end of the plains because there were hills and the grass became more sparse. 

But he was lonely. He missed the people from his tribe. Missed seeing them each morning. He missed his friends. He missed his mother. He thought of them always. What they were doing. What gossip there was. What they were eating for supper. He even missed Mohe. When he returned he would challenge him to a round and show him what’s what. These thoughts passed the time but they made him very lonely and especially at night when there was nothing else around to distract him.

After the third day the fried cakes ran out and he relied on the fish in the river alone to nourish him. He made steady progress even as the landscape inclined. But on the third night he caught no fish, there were none, and that night he went to bed hungry and woke up the next morning with no strength even to fish let alone continue his journey.

How weak I am, Mika said aloud, what would my father say if he could see me now? You are not ready to do the thing I asked of you. You cry like a baby because your feet hurt and your palms bleed. I am ashamed.

Mika lay in the grass feeling low and hungry and lonely for company. He was so hungry. Just a little nourishment and he would be good again. He could continue. Where were the fish? Why had the river not produced any for him? He sat up and looked towards the far mountains. So far away they were. They looked no closer than when he first began. The day ended and Mika had not made any progress and was low in spirit and very hungry. He slept with no fire that night.

He arose early the next morning and began the journey home. He followed the tracks he had made the entire way and felt a deep shame. His hunger never abated. He never caught any fish. Sometimes he found a bush with berries and they gave him some energy. He reached the place where the plains ended and the trees of the valley began. 

It was late afternoon when he rounded the bend and saw the familiar wooden walls that protected his village. Since it was day the gates were open and he walked in. Several of his friends saw him.

Where have you been? They asked, but Mika did not answer. He went to the summer hut he shared with his mother and found her there boiling beans over a fire. When she saw her son she gasped.

How thin you are. And weak. Come inside and rest. I will make you something to eat.

She prepared bread and salted meat and also dried peaches. He ate it all down as his mother looked on, worried but silent. In the corner she saw the empty bucket he had brought inside, but did not ask what it was for. When he was done she washed the blisters on his palms. By now it was evening and the stars had begun to appear overhead.

Mika lay down. His mother gave him a kiss on the forehead.

How does it feel now that you have done your father’s will? He is surely proud of his son. I am proud of you.

That night Mika did not sleep at all and as he lay in bed his view of the stars through the opening in the roof was obscured by tears.

~

One of Mika’s chores every morning was to feed the chickens in the yard, but on this morning when he went out there with the bag of feed he did not see them. He did not hear them either so he went to the small shed with hay inside where they slept. Just outside he saw the same chicken who was in the sweat house the night his father died. It lay on its side without moving. Its black eyes were covered in a milky film. The boy knelt and looked inside the shed at the others. They were all dead.

He looked at the feed in the bag and saw that a few kernals were covered in a black fuzz. He found some kernals on the ground and discovered the same thing.

Mika ran into the center of the village where all the corn in the village was stored and saw people gathered. They all carried bags of corn and other dry goods. There was a sense of worry in the air as they showed one another the contaminated grains and debated about what it could be. Mika recognized the same black fuzz on all their food.

Yonaguska was in charge of the dry good storage in the village he was duly fetched. When he arrived he inspected the grains and  frowned deeply. He told one of the boys to fetch Kulsathee and the other elders. Then he led the group into the graineries where all the corn was kept. There was a central place for it but every person had access to it and could take from it whatever they needed.

It was dark inside but with some of the light from the door it was still plain all the corn inside was also contaminated.

When the elders arrived they were shown the grains. They also frowned. Then one of Mika’s neighbors spoke up.

My pigs ate of this food and now some are sick. Some are dead. What do we do now?

Others said the same thing of their own livestock. Mika told how he had discoverd his chickens. Though it made no sense, the black fuzz had seemed to appear overnight, as nobody had seen it before. By this time the group had grown to a hundred people, everyone carrying examples of contaminated food. Nothing seemed immune to it.

The elders next wanted to inspect the crops in the fields. As a group they went to the Western side of the village where there were large square plots of soil. Every other plot was planted with a particular crops since they rotated by season to not deplete the nutrients. There was mostly corn. Some beans. Peppers. Some squash and pumpkin. Potatoes. Tomatoes. Even spices like mint and cinnamon. From a distance the crops looked fine but upon inspection there was the same black mold growing.

A group of hunters returned at noon that day and they reported game in the forests had been found ill, just as the livestock had been. They brought examples of the mold growing on wild plants.

Panic had been increasing since the morning. Then there was a cry that came from the house of Ninovan and a mother ran through the village carrying Kanuna, her young boy. His skin was blue and there was no life in his eyes which were open. She found the group gathered by the storage buildings and lay him on the ground and asked for their help. Yaholo was fetched and looked the boy over. He said a few words of prayer but there was nothing to be done. He was gone. The mother of Kanuna said her son had eaten some bread and peaches this morning.

Then there were reports from others that some elderly become very sick after eating. Children too.

Kulsathee and the elders told everyone to avoid the food all around until it was determined safe to eat. Since nobody knew how to determine what was safe every kind of food was brought and inspected. The sick were asked what they had eaten that morning and the night before. Strangely it seemed potatoes were the only thing not contaminated by the mold so far and each family horded what they had of them in secret.

Yaholo was asked to perform rites of purification in order to cleanse the food. He consulted some old writings since that particular ritual had not been performed for generations. Though nobody truly believed in the words of the rite to do anything it gave the tribe hope and had value for that reason.

The potato crops were harvested early and kept secure in an isolated shed by Yonaguska. Each day they were rationed out to the families since every other food source was unsafe.

In the following days they discovered more crop contaminated by the black mold and livestock in the village and game in the wilds were found dead or dying. Of the tribe illness affected the elderly and the young more than the others. A very sick elder passed the second night. No other children died.

As the stores of potatoes grew scarce there was a growing panic among the people. Some families ran out faster than others and began to trade clothing and hunting equipment. Some who kept more potatoes than others profited greatly in those days.

Mika and his mother kept an average share of potatoes. They did without breakfast and supper and consumed a single one between them daily, cooking it slow in a pot of boiling water. A struggling father of four came to their hut that night and begged a single potato and at first Ama refused but pitied the man, who was a proud hunter, and gave him two.

Kulsathee called a meeting in the ceremonial grounds the following day and made it mandatory for every member of the tribe to attend. That night there was silence throughout the village as each family prayed to be saved from the blight.

~

Under the tree the people had gathered. The joy and easy living of Spring had been replaced by a desperate anxiety for what was to come. Mika and his mother sat on the ground in silence. He looked around for his friends and saw Leoti and her family near the back. She tended to her baby brother on a blanket and when she saw him she waved. He then saw Tye and his family. Theirs was a large family and had been struggling to feed everyone.

The trunk and branches of the ancient tree provided some shade to the families though it bore no leaves. Once again Mika thought of his father and the thing that had been asked of him. Because of the panic in the village he had put it out of his mind, but now it came back to him. His failure came back. But now was not the time for such things. Mika understood this.

When the sun was directly overhead the elders emerged together from a large house and entered the ceremonial grounds. They wore beadwork and carried the staffs of tradition, which bore carvings of great deeds from the tribe’s history.

Kulsathee led the elders to the log bench and faced the entire group, perhaps three hundred of them. Everyone grew quiet in deference to the *chief of peace*. His old back was curved but he still carried the presence of a true leader. His voice boomed like the sound a large skin drum makes when it is struck.

You must know that a blight has come over our valley. It has affected our stores, our crops, our livestock. It has contaminated plants in the wilds and therefore has sickened game that roam our forests. The only thing not affected at this time are potatoes. Some of our people became ill and we lost some dear ones. This is why we gave counsel to cease eating any food we know to be contaminated or in danger to become contaminated.

We do not know the source of this blight. We do know it acts like a mold and spreads from contact with other contaminated foods. It seems to spread through all varieties of plant, grain, vegetable, and fruit, except potato. We do not know why potatoes are immune and we counsel you to take care and inspect what you eat. Although the blight does not spread via animals or people it can make you sick, or in the case of the sick or small ones, it can kill.

What can we do? A young father shouted. How can we feed our families when the potato stores are depleted?

Some nearby scolded the man for his disrespect but Kulsathee calmed them with a wave of his hand. He was not upset by the outburst.

Do not blame this man for his outburst. This good father has said what all of you want to say. I understand this well. Do not forget I am a father, and a grandfather, and soon to be a great grandfather!

The people laughed and Kulsathee gestured to his large family sat nearby. His grand-daughter rubbed her belly and smiled bashfully.

Fear not. Fear not because together we will overcome this blight. Myself and the elders have discussed many things over the past few days. We have taken counsel with the chief farmers and hunters among you in order to see what can be done. This is what we will do.

Every man who is able to hunt will tomorrow set off on a journey to the next valley. It is a five day journey from here and we do not believe the blight has spread that far. Thus we will enter the next valley to hunt deer, rabbit and other wild game. Accompanying this group will be a small group of women to gather fruits that can be dried and nuts and wild vegetables. There will also be a group of women whose job will be to dress the kills and salt them for the journey back. 

Because we want the hunters to hunt they will remain in the valley and we will set up a system of checkpoints whereby the kills will be delivered and passed onto the next. Then after a week the hunters will return for a break to see their families and to rest. Then we start again.

By doing this we will be able to store enough meat to last throughout the year. Through next Winter. The days are now long but we must not forget they will not always be so. We must not forget that our Mother the Earth is kind but she is also harsh. Our people are strong and by working together will survive this blight. We will not starve.

The pre-dawn mornings of Summer were humid but today there was a gentle breeze that blew across the high grass in the meadow where Tye and Mika hunted together. They were stalking deer. Nearby, a small creek fed into a pond and this particular spot had been lucky to them several times before and they hoped it would be today. 

Tye strapped the decoy to his right arm and crawled flat on his stomach to the edge of the water. Then he lifted the mock deer head in a realistic way so that it could just be seen from afar.

Mika gave a shrill call when the deer was in the right spot and Tye bobbed its head up and down. Waiting for the deer sometimes took hours so when he became tired he would switch out arms. Being the decoy fell on Tye because Mika had the truer aim. The elder hunters had decided this during target practice and Tye did not resent that it was never him to kill the deer when he and Mika hunted together. He respected the elder huntsmen and knew someday his time would come.

As they waited Mika adjusted the tension on his bow and rolled the arrows that lay in the pile next to him. Today was a good day to hunt. The sky was clear. There had been thunderstorms the week before which made things harder, though they still met quota. But today was good, and this week they were well ahead of quota so far. The day before Mika had killed a doe and Tye killed two rabbits on their return to the camp.

There was a rustling in the grass close to the pond and Mika refocused and pulled his bow into a ready position, with the arrow already notched and resting against the wood. Tye had heard the sound also and adjusted his movements to not startle whatever it was that had made the sound.

Soon there was more rustling and then a large buck and doe appeared together at the edge of the pond. Two of them. They drank from the pond and did not seem to regard the decoy at all. This was good. It gave Mika more time to choose the best shot.

He raised up on his haunches so that his eyeline was level with the top of the grass. Without thinking he timed his breaths so they would not interfere with any potential shot that came.

The deer were not in the best position. Mika needed them to walk around the other side. As close as they were he could not risk moving even one inch from his spot. The sound would give him away.

After a few minutes the deer made their way around the other side of the pond. Mika saw the decoy bob and hoped Tye was strong enough to keep it aloft for however long it took. He knew from experience how difficult it was. But now the deer were faced broadside to Mika and he wasted no time and let the arrow fly. It struck the large buck hard just behind his foreleg.

Both deer sprung away as Mika prepared another shot. He wanted to get that doe before it got too far away. He readied the arrow and took a poor shot that missed and disappeared into the grass.

But then Tye rose from his spot near the pond, in the perfect position to hit the fleeing deer, took aim at the doe and shot. His aim was true and struck it mid-stride, causing it to collapse right there.

Wahooo! Tye shouted.

Mika stood upright and beamed at Tye, interlocking his fingers in the gesture of their friendship. He was happy for his friend.  Tye returned the gesture.

They each collected their gear and walked over to where the doe lay next to the pond. The buck they would have to track but they were pretty sure he wouldn’t get too far. Together they set to work field dressing the doe. With their flint knives they opened and gutted her and then stretched out the body in an upright angle so the blood would drain out. Tye tossed the entrails into the grass to be consumed by other animals.

Then they tracked the blood trail that led to the buck. He had made it further than they thought but was easily found in the grass a few hundred yards away. They dressed him out and bound him for the walk to camp. Then they hauled him together to where the doe was.

By now it was midday and they were hungry. They pulled some dried meat and fried potato cakes from the satchel and ate next to the pond. Because they were so famished the food tasted especially good today. They talked about their good fortune. These were good sized kills. This put them well ahead of the other hunting pairs for the week.

I never saw somebody go from decoy to kill shot with such speed, Mika said.

Tye downplayed the compliment but his pride was evident. 

It took the both of us, he said. Your kill shot set me up. All I had to do was aim and shoot.

Mika mocked his friend, All you had to do. They laughed.

After their meal they drank from their water bladders and then refilled them in the pond. With deer of this size it was going to be an arduous haul back to camp. Better to get it over with, Tye sighed. And they set off.

It was late afternoon before they were in sight of the camp. There were other groups of hunters returning also, but it seemed that once again Mika and Tye had the best luck. They were greeted by a group of young women who were in the middle of processing meat from the hunt two days ago. They giggled and pointed at the young hunters, too shy to speak to them. Mika and Tye exchanged glances and nodded as they passed.

Help came when they reached the center of the camp. A group of apprentice hunters took the doe and buck and dragged them to the processing tents to be strung up to dry, before being processed, cut for salting, then carried in packs to the first delivery checkpoint.

Mika and Tye smelled game roasting on a spit over the large fire in the center of camp. They cleaned themselves and joined the hunters there, some of whom rested on their backs, some napping arrowheads for the next days hunt, or sharpening their knives. All in cheerful mood. Things were going well.

The two hunters were welcomed like heroes even among their peers. They fed themselves and sat around the fire. Every night the topic was the day’s hunt, what each man had killed, how he did it, the best spots to find deer or other game. 

Word had already got around how fine Mika and Tye’s kills had been today. The hunters assumed it had been all Mika, but he quickly corrected them and told them all about his friend’s impressive feat. He rose in front of the fire and re-enacted the scene in detail. He described where Tye had been with the decoy, where the pond was, where he himself was, and then from which direction the deer approached. Everyone was impressed. Everyone was happy for their tribal brethren.

The three elder huntsmen came over to congratulate Mika and Tye. 

You have made us proud today, Mika and Tye. One day you will lead us all. This is true!

Then they told everyone to make sure to get rest because since they had met quota the following morning they would be returning to the village for a few days rest. That night the exhausted hunters slept well and dreamed not about the hunt but about home and being reunited with their loved ones.

~

Because the hunters were so excited to be going home the journey took four days instead of five. When they rounded the hill and saw the wooden gates their hearts grew large and they quickened their pace even more. A lookout spotted them and let out a call through the village. They opened both gates and all the families met them there.

Mika’s mother was there, standing with his aunt and nephews. She hugged her son then looked him up and down. His skin was darker from long days in the sun. His hair matted and dirty from many days without cleaning. She ruffled his hair and kissed him on the forehead. He shied away from her touches, embarassed to be seen coddled by his mother. But she did it anyway.

My son, the hunter. The filthy hunter.

I swear he has grown by two inches, one of his aunts remarked.

Mika blushed.

I am happy to see you safe, my son. Everyone in the village now knows me as the mother of Mika, the Boy with the Bow, as the children are saying. The hunter with the truest aim. I am so proud of you!

They walked home together and Mika told her about all the things he had done that week.

[interaction with children of the village who treat him like a hero]

That evening a feast was held with meat roasted on spits and potatoes boiled. The days of panic had passed when they found plenty of food in the neighboring valley. A stockpile of dried and salted meat had already been stored.

There was dancing. There was a large circle where the young people sang together. The boys and girls sang and beat on skin drums and danced to the rhythmic music inside the circle. The girls sang songs about love. Leoti was there. She saw Mika but was very shy. She stood near him but did not look in his direction. When he saw her he touched her shoulder.

They faced one another. Mika had never seen her so beautiful. Her dark, smooth hair draped down side of her deerskin dress, the light from the fire illuminating her soft cheeks. Hunting  in the valley did not make him nearly as nervous as he was around her.

Hello, Leoti, Mika said. We returned today, from the valley.

Yes, my eyes and ears still work, she answered. 

Then she walked away as if she were uninterested in speaking to him. But was that a smile on the corner of her mouth? In the dark it was hard to tell. Mika followed her.

Leoti walked along the circumference of the ceremonial grounds. She walked slow and Mika kept behind. At some point she heard him and turned around.

Are you tracking me?

Mika turned red. Then he walked up and stood by her side. Leoti did not refuse his boldness. They walked together around the empty grounds. They said nothing to one another. There were only the sounds of the celebration on the other side and the light of the large bonfire that reached them by way of a dim glow.

Finally Leoti spoke. You have grown stronger.

Everyone keeps saying that. I don’t know how I could have grown in only a few weeks.

It is true. Or maybe it is your reputation that makes you seem larger. Mika the great hunter. The savior of our tribe. The elders beam when they speak your name. The children tell stories about you like you are the hero in a legend. They play hunt in the forest and every boy wants to be Mika, the boy with the bow.

I only do what has been asked of me.

Leoti mocked him. So humble.

They walked underneath the branches of the ancient tree and she sat against its trunk. Mika joined her there and they did not speak again for some time. But it was a good silence. And when he did at last turn to look at her in the firelight he could see in her eyes the thing they had shared so many times before. It was a sense of gentleness and belonging. Leoti was his and Mika was hers and life in the future was something for them to share.

That night Mika went to sleep and dreamed of Leoti. Of her youthful beauty and tenderness. In his dreams they held one another under the tree. Then he kissed her on the lips and they merged into a single happy being, full of an all-knowing love. And then he gazed up where they sat and saw those branches which spiraled from the base of the ancient tree and all of a sudden remembered the things he had forgotten. He remembered the words of his father on his death bed and what had been asked of him.

Then Mika woke. Above him the night sky was clear. His mother was asleep in the bed nearby. His bare feet planted on the cool earth flooring he sat there for some time. It came back like a bolt from a thundercloud. The tree, his father, the bucket, the failure of the journey, his tears. For the longest time he had forgotten about them. So long that he could no longer be sure that it had happened. Perhaps it never had.

When the blight came there was no time to even consider such things as his father’s request. He had decided that himself. But not decided really. Everyone had been so afraid. Everyone had been so focused on coming up with a plan to survive through next Winter. It was assumed Mika would help. Join in. And he did so. And look how well it had turned out so far. There was plenty again. They were going to be okay. Mika was a hero. His skills at hunting had inspired them all to be better, and now they were. He had so much to be happy for.

And yet he was not happy. His success at hunting felt devoid of purpose. Meaningless. And this confused him greatly. The tribe loved him now. Families he barely knew now went out of their way to be kind to him. Children re-enacted the great kills he and Tye had achieved in the valley. More importantly the tribe had overcome the blight from the great stores of meat they gained by the work he and the other hunters did. And yet to him it was all like a tree that falls deep in the forest. Outward seeming strong, yet brittle to the touch and dead inside. A hollow thing.

And his mother. Leoti. They were very proud and it was his happiness to make them happy. So why this feeling when he was reminded of the tree and his father and the thing that had been asked of him? Did he not want them to be happy? To be proud of him? Mika could not say.

He went outside and walked along the rows of the houses. He heard the people sleeping in their homes. And in the forests he heard the animals and the chirping of the insects. And in the sky the stars far away and the moon low. In the ceremonial grounds the embers of the bonfire still burned. You could still smell the food but it did not make Mika hungry because had stuffed himself. Like everyone had. It was good. Everything was good and yet nothing was. Mika felt that to be true.

Next to the house he shared with his mother was the storage shed. In what little light there was at this hour he entered and found the bucket, once again filled with refuse in the corner. He emptied it and took it outside and looked at it for a long time. He remembered how the handle had blistered his fingers before. There were still some strands of the grass he wrapped around the wood to protect him.

~

It was time for the hunters to return to the valley. That morning there was bustle as the men readied their hunting gear and women gathered provisions for the camp. The children could sense the solemnity and played quietly together. There were no smiles and laughter as there had been the day of their return. But there were many embraces and kisses to show their love to one another.

Always before the journey back to the valley a small ceremony was held on the grounds underneath the tree. Yaholo anointed the hunters with oils and essense and spoke the words of their ancestors to hunt well and to be safe in their journey, both going there and coming back. Only the closest members of the family attended.

And yet when Ama looked around the group she did not see her son Mika there. Others noticed him missing also and approached her.

Where is Mika this morning? Where is the boy with the bow? A few of the elders asked. He should be a part of the blessing. It is important for him to be here.

Some of Mika’s friends also noticed and looked around for their fellow hunter. Ama told them she would find her son and bring him there, at least in time for the departing meal.

When she found her son he was kneeling next to the thin stream  that irrigated the homes nearby, filling his water bladder until it overflowed. Mika rose and faced her. Strapped around his waist was a satchel and it packed with dried deer meat and potato cakes from the celebration. She noticed it was hard for him to look her in the eyes, so she stood in front of him until he no choice.

Why did you not attend the hunters ceremony this morning? It is important for you to be there and for others to see you there. For many reasons it is important. Do I have to explain it to you why it is important?

I did not attend the ceremony for the hunters because I do not intend to hunt in the valley. And if I will not hunt then why should I attend the ceremony for the hunters.

Ama saw the bucket next to the door of the shed, along with a few other tools for the journey.

Is this because of what your father asked you to do?

It is, Mika answered. For the first time he looked her directly in the eyes. He saw she regarded him with love but also suspicion.

But you have already fulfilled his request. I remember when you left. I remember when you returned.

Ama looked at her son as though she wasn’t sure she knew him anymore.

No. I failed, mama. And in my dreams last night I was reminded of that failure. So I must try again. And not fail.

But the people of this tribe depend upon you. You are the best hunter among them. And this is a time of survival. You know what has been decreed by the elders, by Kulsathee. Every able man to hunt. Remember the blight? Remember the panic? Those times are not in the past yet. Nothing is certain.

I must obey my father. That is certain.

You are mistaken. Your father was not in his right mind, Mika. He was sick. It was not him that spoke to you that night. It was the fever. Please understand that. Whatever it was, it was from madness caused by the fever. Please don’t turn your back on your tribe during this crucial time. They are your people. I will always love you as my son but I will not support this behavior. I cannot support it.

With these words Mika turned to face his mother. Her words were stern. Her face resolute. Mika saw that he was truly alone.

He picked his things from the ground, his flint knife, the bucket whose handle was wrapped with a thick layer of grass. He tucked the knife in his satchel and gripped the bucket in his left hand. He walked away. 

Ama cried.

After the ceremony the hunters and their wives and children ate together in the yard. There was cooked game, potato cakes. As Mika went by on the path he smelled the food and watched them. His friend Tye saw him and waved him over to join them. Mika did not go. Tye was confused and interlocked his fingers in the gesture of their friendship. Mika did not return the gesture.

Please understand, my friend, I must go alone.

He avoided everyone else by keeping his head down. He passed the circle of elders who gathered near the home of Kulsathee daily to smoke and talk about the old days. But he did not look in their direction, though he knew they saw him walking by.

Though I honor you, elders, I must go alone.

He saw Leoti among her friends near the creek. They were cleaning deer skins. She saw him and stopped working. The other girls noticed and teased her. But Mika did not approach. He felt that to speak to her now might sway him from the journey. He was stronger than he was before, but did not think he was strong enough to resist her power over him.

Forgive me, Leoti, I must go alone.

When Leoti realized Mika would not speak to her she was clearly hurt and returned to the work. From time to time she looked towards the road in hope that he would return though he did not.

At the Northern gate stood Gawoni and a few other lookouts. They looked bored standing there with nothing to do in these times of peace. A couple of them amused themselves with games of dice.

Though the gates were open because of it being daytime, Mika stopped when he saw them there. He felt he should say goodbye to someone at least. And there was no chance they would sway him from the journey he must take.

Hello again, Gawoni.

Hello, Mika. Why are you not with the other hunters? They are leaving soon, though by the Southern gates.

I am not going with them.

But where is your bow?

I did not bring it with me.

One of the lookouts, someone Mika did not know, spoke to him.

But you are the Boy with the Bow, the greatest hunter among us. You and Tye are responsible for the majority of the food that has been gathered since the blight. Why will you not hunt?

Mika nodded and then answered, I must do what my father has asked of me. When that is done, then will I pick up my bow again. Only then.

The lookouts saw the bucket he carried and whispered among themselves. By their snears Mika could see they resented him for abandoning the tribe in this time of need.

Safe travels, Boy with the Bucket, Gawoni said. The others laughed at that clever turn of phrase.

Mika walked outside the gates onto the dirt path. He did not  turn back to address their riducule, which continued until he rounded the rock bend and was therefore out of earshot.

~

The grass grew thin at this altitude from the hard, partially-frozen soil on the high plains. The river he always kept on his left side had become narrower and shallower, its rich sediment bottom had become polished stones. Its water ran clear and was very cold. Still the far mountains loomed on the horizon, obscured in a blue, atmospheric haze. After three days journey Mika had at last reached the point where he gave up before.

Next to the river bank he found the old campsite. Rain seldom fell at this altitude, so there were still ashen remnants of the last fire he built. He collected some twigs and chopped some bushes for kindling and fuel.

As before his food had already run out. Though he had rationed it with care he did not have enough space in the satchel to carry more. But he was not the same boy who had been out here before. He was strong. He was a hunter.

Nearby there were some marmot holes and he patiently waited for them to emerge, knife in hand. Marmots, who live in the ground, are particuarly sensitive to footsteps so he was careful to crawl to the spot. Hours passed and nothing appeared. By now it was getting dark.

No food for you tonight, Mika.

In the solitude of the journey he had begun speaking to himself for company. At first it was strange to do, but he had gotten used to hearing his voice and it did make him feel less alone.

He went to the marmot hole and stomped his foot. Then he got down and put his ear to the ground. There was no movement.

Likely an abandoned hole. Makes sense. This is no place for rodents.

Mika put food out of his mind and started a fire. By now the sun was just above the Western horizon and a vivid sheet of red stretched into the darkness there. The first stars had appeared. He went to the river to wash the day’s grime from his face and upper body. When he reached his hand into that cold water he felt something move.

Out of instinct he grasped around underneath the water and felt it again. A fish. Then another. But they were too slippery for him to grab. Luckily he had brought some netting, even though the river had not yielded any fish at home since the blight. He cast the netting wide in the same spot and dragged it deep. When he pulled it out of the water there were two trout squirming around. Upon a rock he cleaned the fish with his knife and skewered them with a twig. Then he roasted both on the fire. Then he ate. It was the best fish he ever tasted. The second he saved for the next day since he did not think his luck would last. It would keep that long.

With his belly full Mika bedded down. He gazed up at the beauty of that clear, dark night and thought about all his loved ones back home. Before long he was asleep and did not wake again until morning.

Mika walked for many days. The journey through the plains had been hard but it was nothing compared to the mountainous landscape that enveloped him. It was harsh, lifeless. The only movement here at all was the streaming of the river and a wind that never ceased. 

The bucket he carried no longer gave him blisters as it had before. Now on both hands there were callouses as tough as leather. Though he did keep the handle wrapped in grass. He also had a good idea to put kindling and fuel wood in the bucket for the journey to the mountain. Though there were shrubs and small trees he knew he would not be able to count on them as he climbed. 

His luck with the fish had not run out. Without fail he caught a couple each night and cooked them on the fire. They nourished him on the journey and he was grateful.

It was hard for Mika to gauge how many days he had spent out here. Time did not seem to pass the same as in the valley. There was daylight and evening, and the sun rose and the sun went down, and yet he discovered that at any particular time he could only remember few days before today. Time blurred. But there were other ways to tell that some amount of time had passed. He knew he had lost weight because his ribs were now visible. That had not been true for many years. 

Mika did not think about home while he walked. That he would not allow himself to do, remembering the loneliness and how it had overcome him before. He spoke aloud to keep it at bay. But the things he spoke were not merely for diversion. They were to keep himself focused on the journey. I am on the path, he repeated whenever he was particularly sad, I am on the path.

One afternoon there was a moment when all Mika could hear was the whistle of the wind around a jagged outcrop. He then saw the river was gone. His first thought was that he had lost it by not paying attention. By letting his mind become unfocused. He sat on the ground and panicked.

But as he sat there he heard the muffled sound of water flowing underground. He placed his ear against the rocks. The sound grew louder. Mika then scanned the area for any kind of opening. He saw nothing apparent. Then he continued up the mountain, making sure he could always hear the flowing water under his feet.

He came to a plateau where the rocks leveled out. Above him an enormous natural archway blocked out any sunlight and blanketed the entire area in shadows. At the other end Mika saw an opening where light returned. It was cold here and a harsh wind whipped through the funnel the archway made. Mika put on his deerskin shirt and folded his arms together, the bucket beating against his thigh. He entered and let his eyes become accustomed to the lack of sunlight.

The sound of the river was loud under the archway. It echoed off the high walls and reverberated into echoes. Mika walked to the middle of the plateau and came to a wide chasm there. The dark of the shadows grew deeper as he peered into it. There was no bottom. Yet there was where the sound of the river came from. By the smooth rush the water made he knew it must be deep there. Likely he was near the source.

Mika looked again at the opening on the other end of the plateau. He walked along the chasm and saw what he was looking for. A glint of sunlight blinded him and he held up his hand. It was there.

Mika surveyed the width of the chasm. It was twenty feet across. Impossible to jump. Perhaps he had made a mistake after all. Perhaps there had been a better approach. He retraced his footsteps outside to where the plateau dropped off. Along the mountainside shear cliffs rose to great heights. Impossible to climb. Mika walked back to the edge and sat down near it. There he meditated on the opening on the other side. The sunlight shining through the opening on the other side. He listened to the roar of the river. The roar he heard at the bottom of the chasm, but could not see. After some time he rose and then tied a piece of twine from the handle of the bucket around his arm. He tugged on it to make sure it was secure and then walked right up to the ledge of the chasm. Then he fell in.
