HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung in the stars to the East and when Mika saw it behind the tree line he knew it was morning and yet hours before the sunrise. The boy followed behind an old woman who had roused him from slumber only moments before. How strange it was. The hush in the surrounding woods. The frowns on the faces of the tribal elders. The howling chant of the young girls who beat their turtle-shell rattles and would not make eye contact with him. Mika wondered if this were not some dream he had yet to awaken from. Soon they came to a small mud hut at the end of the hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. His father was the shaman of the village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay inside.

The old woman parted the deerskin hung over the small entrance and then stood by and joined the girls in their chant. Mika entered alone.

Inside were three others. Yaholo, a pupil of the shaman, a man of small stature and middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role, but was well-liked among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was. He stood over the embers in the center of the hut and repeated the ancient words in a low voice. His mother Ama stood in the corner farthest from the ceremony and watched Mika with an expression of pity. And next to the far, raised on a bed made from cane reeds and covered with blankets, was his father Sakima.

The boy did not know quite what to do. No one had told him. But he approached the bed and placed his hand on his father’s. The skin was dry and cold. This surprised him because it was so hot in the sweat house, the coals in the center giving off so much heat and light he felt his back getting hot. The old man was not conscious. His eyes rolled and his head turned from one side to the other. He seemed in great pain.

Mika turned to Yaholo and made eye contact with him. But Yaholo only repeated the words of the ceremony and looked at him as if he were a stranger. He was in another place.

There was a jar of water and he picked it up and poured some into his hand and gave to his father. When the moisture hit his lips he came around and his eyes focused on Mika. There were tears in them. Strength returned to his hand and he took the smaller hand of his son into his.

Son, his father said, come to me.

Mika placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the salve of the ritual. He looked up and saw the shadows of Yaholo move across the charcoal-burned plaster of the ceiling. In the corner underneath the cane bench there he saw a hen sat and grew angry at it being there. What place did it have here? Those stupid black eyes watching all.

Then his father Sakima whispered something into his ear and Mika forgot the hen and listened and everything else in the hut disappeared while he spoke. And when his father was finished he collapsed back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had heard the words of his father correctly. Then he looked at his mother in the corner. Her eyes were wet with tears. He went to console her.

At that point Yaholo approached his father and his words grew louder. He pulled a baton decorated with green soapstone carvings and shook it over Sakima. Together he and his mother watched. The old shaman came to life once more and shook from the core of his body and seemed in great pain. Mika left to tend to him but his mother pulled him back. He saw the stupid hen under the bench was now scratching and pecking at the dirt and this filled Mika with rage. He escaped his mother’s embrace and ran to the hen but then his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard from him.

He was awake again. His eyes were wide. He raised from the bed and shouted in anger at Yaholo. There were tears in his pupil’s eyes but he continued the words of the ceremony. Then Sakima looked at his son. His eyes were wild. There was fear in them.

Will you?

All turned to Mika as his father asked him this question repeatedly. Mika did not answer. Then Sakima collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had when Mika had first entered the hut. And when the boy saw the chicken again next to the bed he could take no more of it and ran outside.

The air outside was cool. The others stood in silence and looked to Mika for any information. He ignored them and ran to the center of the village, a clearing one acre square, the ceremonial ground where many times he and his father had sat together. 

In the middle of the ceremonial ground was an old, dead tree. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It bark was smooth and stone-like. The tree was sacred to the village. It was even the symbol of their tribe. The tree was from another, more ancient time. Mika had climbed on it since he was a boy and he asked his father about it, where it had come from, and his father had always said he didn’t know.

Now he sat at the base of the tree alone. It was the darkest time of night. The stars now gone. The morning yet to come. He remembered times he shared with his father and soon fell asleep underneath the tree. Then later, after Sakima had passed from this world into the next, his mother found him there and wrapped a blanket around him.

The next day a platform built from reed was raised within the ceremonial grounds. It stood six feet off the ground. The dead shaman was placed upon it and his body was then anointed with oils and the women arranged sashes made from flowers about the base. Here Sakima would lie until the counsel of elders decided it was time to bury him. It was the same for every great man.

Then there was the feast, or what was called *the ceremony of the dead*. For three evenings a large bonfire was kindled on the ceremonial grounds and food was gathered and prepared. The men set up roasting spits and skewered them with deer, pigs, rabbits and other game. Long tables were brought out and set upon them were clay bowls and pots filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, kanuchi, which is a soup. All the families of the village brought something and all were welcome to partake and pay their respects to the beloved leader. Gathered together they numbered in the hundreds.

Mika walked among them. He was alone and tried to stay invisible though it was hard. He did not like to be consoled for the loss of his father. He did not like to be reminded what a great man his father was. He even avoided his mother because of the way she now looked at him.

He found a hidden spot away from the crowd and sat there and watched the people of the village. They were kind people. He did not resent them. He just wanted to be alone with his thoughts.

As he sat there his thoughts turned to the ancient tree in the shadow of the bonfire flames. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. He was reminded of the last words his father spoke to him and wondered what they meant. He wanted the ghost of his father to visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant. Why he must do this particular thing. But inside he knew such things did not happen. Only in stories did they happen.

At the edge of the fires he saw his good friend Tye. He wanted to go up to him and joke with him and do the things they always did together. But it was not appropriate now. Tye was a hunter like Mika and it did not take him long to spy his friend hidden in the dark. Tye was savvy. He knew Mika and did not approach him. Instead he made a gesture with his hands by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain. A symbol of their friendship. Mika returned the gesture and his eyes welled with tears.

But as he exchanged gestures with his friend someone else had discovered him and approached from behind. She emerged into the flickering of the light carrying a small bowl. Her hair was braided and hung down one shoulder. She was beautiful indeed. The last time Mika had seen her she was part of the group of girls who had chanted with the turtle shell rattles.

She placed the bowl on the ground in front of him and demurred. Mika watched her and then looked at the bowl.

You must eat, she said.

He picked up the bowl and drank the soup down. Kanuchi was one of his favorites. She sat a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat. Still hot. Steam rising from within.

Eat, Mika.

He noticed she did not try to console him though he could see the pity in her eyes. He unraveled the cloth and ate. His mood changed as the food restored energy to his body. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how hungry he was.

Thank you, Leoti.

She smiled and sat with him for awhile. He was happy she was here. He looked at all the people and for the first time that evening understood that it was love that had brought them together. And he felt it himself. He was happy.

The elders of the tribe then gathered around the fire and the people gathered around them and sat. Mika and Leoti came closer and sat beside the others. Then, in turn, each of the village elders told stories about his father, Sakima the Shaman. As he listened Mika was filled with such pride at the things they said. Half of them he had never heard before.

At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the center of the group of elders, a large rotund man the same age as his father. He was what they called the *Chief of Peace* and had been the leader of the tribe ever since before Mika was born. There were deep lines in his face and when he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather.

The old Kulsathee told a story of how he and Sakima were out hunting one day, far away from the village, when they were just boys. Far away, he repeated. Many weeks. They were hunting bison  in the plains and decided to explore the valleys of the Southern Mountains. He spread his arms around him. 

These green valleys, he said. How we loved them. We found deer, pigs, squirrels. Turkey, geese. And then my friend, Sakima the brave and good, he took a walk one morning and discovered our tree. Kulsathee raised his arm and pointed the dead, ancient branches hung over the group. The people knew it well.

Sakima found our tree and had a vision that day, that our tribe would establish here. On this spot. So we returned and told the elders what we had found and about the vision Sakima had.
