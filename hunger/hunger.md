HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung low among the stars in the night sky to the East. Mika 
saw the moon and therefore knew it was morning and yet hours before the sunrise. 
He followed behind those who had roused him moments ago in a twilight of consciousness 
and wondered when he saw the rows of children dancing and chanting together in such 
mournful song if this were not some bad dream he had yet to awaken from. The boy 
was led to a small mud house at the far end of a hamlet of buildings that made up 
the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with 
fatal hunting injuries or for illnesses that had no cure. Mika's father was the 
shaman and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him on his 
deathbed. Instead the rites were being performed by his pupil Yaholo, a man of 
small stature and middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role but 
was well-liked among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was.

"Will you?"

But his father was no longer there. It was only a body.
