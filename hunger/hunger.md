HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung in the stars to the East and when Mika saw it behind the tree line he knew it was morning and yet hours before the sunrise. The boy followed behind an old woman who had roused him from slumber only moments before. How strange it was. The hush in the surrounding woods. The frowns on the faces of the tribal elders. The howling chant of the young girls who beat their turtle-shell rattles and would not make eye contact with him. Mika wondered if this were not some dream he had yet to awaken from. Soon they came to a small mud hut at the end of the hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. His father was the shaman of the village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay inside.

The old woman parted the deerskin hung over the small entrance and then stood by and joined the girls in their chant. Mika entered alone.

Inside were three others. Yaholo, a pupil of the shaman, a man of small stature and middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role, but was well-liked among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was. He stood over the embers in the center of the hut and repeated the ancient words in a low voice. His mother Ama stood in the corner farthest from the ceremony and watched Mika with an expression of pity. And next to the far, raised on a bed made from cane reeds and covered with blankets, was his father Sakima.

The boy did not know quite what to do. No one had told him. But he approached the bed and placed his hand on his father’s. The skin was dry and cold. This surprised him because it was so hot in the sweat house, the coals in the center giving off so much heat and light he felt his back getting hot. The old man was not conscious. His eyes rolled and his head turned from one side to the other. He seemed in great pain.

Mika turned to Yaholo and made eye contact with him. But Yaholo only repeated the words of the ceremony and looked at him as if he were a stranger. He was in another place.

There was a jar of water and he picked it up and poured some into his hand and gave to his father. When the moisture hit his lips he came around and his eyes focused on Mika. There were tears in them. Strength returned to his hand and he took the smaller hand of his son into his.

Son, his father said, come to me.

Mika placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the salve of the ritual. He looked up and saw the shadows of Yaholo move across the charcoal-burned plaster of the ceiling. In the corner underneath the cane bench there he saw a hen sat and grew angry at it being there. What place did it have here? Those stupid black eyes watching all.

Then his father Sakima whispered something into his ear and Mika forgot the hen and listened and everything else in the hut disappeared while he spoke. And when his father was finished he collapsed back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had heard the words of his father correctly. Then he looked at his mother in the corner. Her eyes were wet with tears. He went to console her.

At that point Yaholo approached his father and his words grew louder. He pulled a baton decorated with green soapstone carvings and shook it over Sakima. Together he and his mother watched. The old shaman came to life once more and shook from the core of his body and seemed in great pain. Mika left to tend to him but his mother pulled him back. He saw the stupid hen under the bench was now scratching and pecking at the dirt and this filled Mika with rage. He escaped his mother’s embrace and ran to the hen but then his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard from him.

He was awake again. His eyes were wide. He raised from the bed and shouted in anger at Yaholo. There were tears in his pupil’s eyes but he continued the words of the ceremony. Then Sakima looked at his son. His eyes were wild. There was fear in them.

Will you?

All turned to Mika as his father asked him this question repeatedly. Mika did not answer. Then Sakima collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had when Mika had first entered the hut. And when the boy saw the chicken again next to the bed he could take no more of it and ran outside.

The air outside was cool. The others stood in silence and looked to Mika for any information. He ignored them and ran to the center of the village, a clearing one acre square, the ceremonial ground where many times he and his father had sat together. 

In the middle of the ceremonial ground was an old, dead tree. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It bark was smooth and stone-like. The tree was sacred to the village. It was even the symbol of their tribe. The tree was from another, more ancient time. Mika had climbed on it since he was a boy and he asked his father about it, where it had come from, and his father had always said he didn’t know.

Now he sat at the base of the tree alone. It was the darkest time of night. The stars gone. The morning to come soon. He remembered those times and soon fell asleep against the tree. Then later, after his father had passed on, his mother found him there and covered him with a blanket.
