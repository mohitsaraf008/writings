HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung among the stars to the East and when Mika saw it emerge from 
behind the hilltop he knew it was morning and yet hours still before the sunrise. He 
followed behind those who had roused him and imagined when he saw the row of young 
girls dancing with their ceremonial beads and chanting together in that mournful song 
that all of this might be some bad dream he had yet to awaken from. The boy was 
led to a small mud hut at the far end of a hamlet of buildings that made up the healing 
area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting 
injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. Mika's father was the shaman of the 
village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay 
inside. 


Instead the rites were being performed by his pupil Yaholo, a man of small stature and 
middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role but was well-liked 
among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was.

"Will you?"

But his father was no longer there. It was only a body now.
