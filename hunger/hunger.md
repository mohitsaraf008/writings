HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung in the stars to the East and when Mika saw it behind the tree line he knew it was morning and yet hours before the sunrise. The boy followed behind an old woman who had roused him from slumber only moments before. How strange it was. The hush in the nearby woods. The frowns on the faces of the tribal elders they passed by. The howling chant of the young women, some his friends, who beat on turtle-shell rattles and whose eyes stared into a faraway place. Mika wondered if this were some dream he had yet to awaken from. Soon they came to a small mud hut at the end of the hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. His father was the shaman of the village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay inside.

His guide parted the deerskin hung over the small entrance and then stood by and joined the girls in their chanting. Mika entered alone.

Inside were three others. Yaholo, a pupil of the shaman, a man of small stature and middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role, but was well-liked among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was. He stood over the embers in the center of the hut and muttered the ancient words of the rite. His mother Ama stood in the corner farthest from the ceremony and watched Mika with an expression of pity. Her hands clasped against her breast. And next to the wall on a bed woven from reed was his father Sakima.

The boy did not know what he should do. No one had told him what to do. But he approached the bed and placed his hand on his father’s. The skin was dry and cold. This was surprising because it was so hot in the sweat house, the coals in the center giving off so much heat and light he felt his back getting hot. The old man was not conscious. His eyes rolled back. His head turned from one side to the other. He seemed in great pain.

Mika turned to Yaholo and made eye contact with him. But Yaholo only repeated the words and looked at him as if he were a stranger. He was in a faraway place too.

There was a jar of water and he picked it up and poured some into his hand and gave to his father. When the moisture hit his lips he came around and his eyes focused on Mika. There were tears in them. Strength returned to his hand and he took the smaller hand of his son into his.

Son, his father said, come to me.

Mika placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the salve of the ritual. He looked up and saw the shadows of Yaholo move across the charcoal-burned plaster of the ceiling. In the corner underneath the cane bench he saw a chicken perched. He grew angry at it being there. What place did it have here? Those stupid black eyes watching all.

Then his father Sakima whispered something into his ear and Mika forgot the chicken and listened and everything else in the hut vanished while he spoke. There were only the words, the weak, foul breath in his ear. Asking something of him, his father’s son. His will. And when there was nothing more to say the old man collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had heard the words of his father correctly. Then he looked at his mother in the corner. Her eyes were wet with tears. He went to console her.

Yaholo approached Sakima and suddenly his voice grew. He pulled a baton decorated in green soapstone and shook it rhythmically over the sick shaman. From the corner of the building Mika and his mother watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He was in great pain. Mika left to tend to him but his mother pulled him back. He saw the stupid chicken under the bench now pecking at the dirt and this filled Mika with rage. He escaped his mother’s embrace and chase it outside but then his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard from him.

He was awake again. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and yelled in anger at Yaholo. Tears came to his pupil’s eyes but he continued to speak the words of the ceremony. Then Sakima looked at his son. His eyes were wild. There was fear in them.

Will you?

All turned to Mika as his father asked him this question repeatedly. Mika did not answer. Then Sakima collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had when Mika had first entered the hut. And when the boy saw the chicken again next to the bed he could take no more of it and ran outside.

The air outside was cool. The others stood in silence and looked to Mika for any information. He ignored them and ran to the center of the village, a clearing one acre square, the ceremonial ground where many times he and his father had sat together. 

In the middle of the ceremonial ground was an old, dead tree. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It bark was smooth and stone-like. The tree was sacred to the village. Its symbol in fact. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. Mika had climbed on it since he was a boy and he asked his father about it, where it had come from, and his father had always said he didn’t know. He used to imagine the creatures who inhabited the world when it lived, feeding on its leaves. Strange beings.

Now he sat at the base of the tree alone. It was the darkest time of night. The stars were gone. The morning yet to come. He remembered times he shared with his father and soon fell asleep underneath the tree. Later, after Sakima had passed from this world into the next, his mother found him there and wrapped a blanket around him.

Then there was a three-day feast, what was known among tribes of the southern valleys as the *ceremony of the dead*. A large bonfire was kindled on the ceremonial grounds and every kind food was prepared. Families from the village and even some from the surrounding hills were invited to pay their final respects and to enjoy the food and the company of friends.

A platform woven from reed was raised within the ceremonial grounds and Sakima was placed upon it, his body anointed with scented oils and adorned with the wampum he wore during his lifetime. The platform stood six feet off the ground. The women arranged sashes made from flowers about the base. Here the shaman would lie until the elders decided it was time to bury him in the ground. It was the same for every great man.

The men set up roasting spits and skewered them with deer, pigs, rabbits and other game. Long tables were brought out and set upon them were clay bowls and pots filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and kanuchi, which is a soup made from hickory nuts. All the families of the village brought something and all were welcome to partake and pay their respects to the beloved shaman. Gathered they numbered in the hundreds.

Mika walked among them. He was alone and tried to stay invisible though it was hard. He did not like to be consoled for the loss of his father. He did not like to be reminded what a great man his father was. He even avoided his mother because of the way she looked at him now. Those sad eyes, filled with pity.

He found a hidden spot, away from the crowd, and sat upon a log to watch the villagers. They were kind people who meant well. He did not resent them. He wanted only to be left alone.

As he sat his thoughts turned to the ancient tree in the shadow of the bonfire flames. There it loomed over them all. Ignored, but happy to be ignored. Just like him. He thought of the last words his father had spoken to him and wondered what they meant. He wanted the ghost of his father to visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant and what to do about them. Why he must do that particular thing. But inside he knew such things did not happen. Only in stories did they happen.

Then at the edge of the bonfire he saw his good friend Tye. He wanted to go up to him and joke with him like before. Yet he knew it was not appropriate now. Tye was a hunter like Mika and so it did not take him long to spy his friend hidden in the darkness. Tye was savvy. He did not approach. Instead he made a gesture with both hands by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, a secret symbol of their friendship. Mika returned the gesture from his spot on the log with solemnity. Tye his true friend.

But someone else had discovered him there in the darkness of the bonfire light and approached him from behind, in secret. She emerged carrying a small bowl. Her hair was braided and hung down one shoulder. She was beautiful indeed. The last time Mika had seen Leoti she was part of the group of girls who chanted with the turtle shell rattles outside the sick house. She placed the bowl on the ground in front of him and demurred. Mika watched her and then glanced at the bowl.

You must eat, she said.

He picked up the bowl and drank the soup down. Kanuchi was one of his favorites. She sat a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat. Still hot. Steam rising from within.

Eat, Mika.

He noticed she did not try to console him though he could see the pity in her eyes. He unraveled the cloth and ate. His mood changed as the food restored energy to his body. The meat was good. The bread too. He had not realized how hungry he was.

Thank you, Leoti.

She smiled and sat with him for awhile. He was happy she was here. He looked at all the people and for the first time that evening understood that it was love that had brought them together. And he felt it himself.

The elders of the tribe then gathered around the fire and the people gathered around them and sat. Mika and Leoti came closer and sat beside the others. Then, in turn, each of the village elders told stories about his father, Sakima the Shaman. As he listened Mika was filled with such pride at the things they said. Half of them he had never heard before.

At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the center of the group of elders, a large rotund man the same age as his father. He was what they called the *Chief of Peace* and had been the leader of the tribe ever since before Mika was born. There were deep lines in his face and when he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather.

The old Kulsathee told a story of how he and Sakima were out hunting one day, far away from the village, when they were just boys. Far away, he repeated. Many weeks. They were hunting bison  in the plains and decided to explore the valleys of the Southern Mountains. He spread his arms around him. 

These green valleys he said. How we loved them. We found deer and pigs, squirrels and turkey. And then my good friend, Sakima the brave, he took a walk by himself one morning and discovered our tree. Kulsathee then raised his arm and gestured toward its dead, ancient branches. The people knew it well.

Sakima found our tree and had a vision that day. He foresaw that our tribe would establish here on this very spot. So we returned and told the elders what we had found and about the vision Sakima had. They laughed at him and called him just a boy. But the next year was the bloody war among the plains people and we uprooted. We traveled there as it seemed a safe haven from the death and desolation of the plains.

The old *Chief of Peace* continued to tell stories of Sakima, well into morning. He told of the establishment of the tribe in the hills around. He told of the first council that united the neighboring tribes together. And when he was done there were tears in his eyes and the people watching were amazed as they had never seen him show emotion as he did that night.

It was then, in the lull between speakers, that Mika felt compelled himself to rise and tell the crowd about what his father had spoken to him just before his death.

Mika rose from his spot in the darkness, to Leoti’s surprise, and approached the center of the circle, near the flames of the bonfire. No one spoke when they saw him approach. 

He stood before them with his head bowed. Moments went by in silence as he collected his thoughts. Then he raised his head and observed them. He looked into their eyes. Each one. They were expectant and hopeful. They wanted to hear something to inspire them. To let them know it was okay for a great man to die. But Mika did not speak. It was not for them, those words his father spoke to him. He had not understood until that moment, as he stood before those hundreds that what had been asked of him was not for them to know and that it would be a betrayal to the memory of his father to repeat those words to those whom it had not been given.

He met their eyes and kept silent. The people stirred and wanted him to say something, yet he would not. Some took it as arrogance and wrinkled their noses in disgust. Some laughed at him. Some said he was not the man his father was.
