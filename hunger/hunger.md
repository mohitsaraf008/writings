HUNGER by Daniel Stepp

I.

Mika was led to the wigwam at the far end of a small hamlet that made up the 
shaman's area of the village. Here there were three wigwams altogether. The one on 
the end was where they took those with life-threatening hunting injuries or for 
illnesses that had no known cure. Mika's father was the shaman of the village 
and normally would have been performing the ritual tonight but since it was he who 
was sick the rites were being performed by his pupil Yaholo, a man of middle-age who 
did not have much gift for the role, but always did his best.

From the low position of the moon Mika knew it was early morning and hours before 
sunrise. He was still in a twilight of consciousness from being awoken only moments before but 
prepared himself for what was to come. Already he heard cries of pain from within. 
Hearing his father shout with such weakness pained him in a way he could not understand. 
Then there was a scream so loud everyone outside the entrance grasped their chests in 
reflex. He was awake now. 

But his father was no longer there. It was only a body.
