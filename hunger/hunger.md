HUNGER by Daniel Stepp


A crescent moon hung in the stars to the East and when Mika saw it behind the tree line he knew it was morning and yet hours before the sunrise. The boy followed behind an old woman who had roused him from slumber only moments before. How strange it was. The hush in the nearby woods. The frowns on the faces of the tribal elders they passed by. The howling chant of the young women, some his friends, who beat on turtle-shell rattles and whose eyes stared into a faraway place. Mika wondered if this were some dream he had yet to awaken from. Soon they came to a small mud hut at the end of the hamlet of buildings that made up the healing area of the village. The one on the end was where they took those with fatal hunting injuries or for sicknesses that had no cure. His father was the shaman of the village and would have been performing the ritual tonight were it not him who lay inside.

His guide parted the deerskin hung over the small entrance and then stood by and joined the girls in their chanting. Mika entered alone.

Inside were three others. Yaholo, a pupil of the shaman, a man of small stature and middle-age paunch who did not have much talent for the role, but was well-liked among the tribe because he never pretended to be more than he was. He stood over the embers in the center of the hut and muttered the ancient words of the rite. His mother Ama stood in the corner farthest from the ceremony and watched Mika with an expression of pity. Her hands clasped against her breast. And next to the wall on a bed woven from reed was his father Sakima.

The boy did not know what he should do. No one had told him what to do. But he approached the bed and placed his hand on his father’s. The skin was dry and cold. This was surprising because it was so hot in the sweat house, the coals in the center giving off so much heat and light he felt his back getting hot. The old man was not conscious. His eyes rolled back. His head turned from one side to the other. He seemed in great pain.

Mika turned to Yaholo and made eye contact with him. But Yaholo only repeated the words and looked at him as if he were a stranger. He was in a faraway place too.

There was a jar of water and he picked it up and poured some into his hand and gave to his father. When the moisture hit his lips he came around and his eyes focused on Mika. There were tears in them. Strength returned to his hand and he took the smaller hand of his son into his.

Son, his father said, come to me.

Mika placed his head against his father’s chest and smelled the salve of the ritual. He looked up and saw the shadows of Yaholo move across the charcoal-burned plaster of the ceiling. In the corner underneath the cane bench he saw a chicken perched. He grew angry at it being there. What place did it have here? Those stupid black eyes watching all.

Then his father Sakima whispered something into his ear and Mika forgot the chicken and listened and everything else in the hut vanished while he spoke. There were only the words, the weak, foul breath in his ear. Asking something of him, his father’s son. His will. And when there was nothing more to say the old man collapsed onto his back and went unconscious again. The boy rose and looked at his father, unsure if he had heard the words of his father correctly. Then he looked at his mother in the corner. Her eyes were wet with tears. He went to console her.

Yaholo approached Sakima and suddenly his voice grew. He pulled a baton decorated in green soapstone and shook it rhythmically over the sick shaman. From the corner of the building Mika and his mother watched. Sakima came to life once more and shook from the core of his body. He was in great pain. Mika left to tend to him but his mother pulled him back. He saw the stupid chicken under the bench now pecking at the dirt and this filled Mika with rage. He escaped his mother’s embrace and chase it outside but then his father let out a cry unlike anything he had ever heard from him.

He was awake again. His eyes wide. He raised from the bed like a statue and yelled in anger at Yaholo. Tears came to his pupil’s eyes but he continued to speak the words of the ceremony. Then Sakima looked at his son. His eyes were wild. There was fear in them.

Will you?

All turned to Mika as his father asked him this question repeatedly. Mika did not answer. Then Sakima collapsed onto the bed again and shouted in pain and a few minutes later grew silent, eyes rolled back in his head, much as he had when Mika had first entered the hut. And when the boy saw the chicken again next to the bed he could take no more of it and ran outside.

The air outside was cool. The others stood in silence and looked to Mika for any information. He ignored them and ran to the center of the village, a clearing one acre square, the ceremonial ground where many times he and his father had sat together. 

In the middle of the ceremonial ground was an old, dead tree. It had wide, gnarled branches good to climb and rose high above the surrounding trees of the forest. It bark was smooth and stone-like. The tree was sacred to the village. Its symbol in fact. The tree was not from this time. It was from another, more ancient world than theirs. Mika had climbed on it since he was a boy and he asked his father about it, where it had come from, and his father had always said he didn’t know. He used to imagine the creatures who inhabited the world when it lived, feeding on its leaves. Strange beings.

Now he sat at the base of the tree alone. It was the darkest time of night. The stars were gone. The morning yet to come. He remembered times he shared with his father and soon fell asleep underneath the tree. Later, after Sakima had passed from this world into the next, his mother found him there and wrapped a blanket around him.

~

There was a three-day feast in the village, what was known among tribes of the southern valleys as a *ceremony of the dead*. A large bonfire was kindled on the ceremonial grounds and every kind of food was prepared. Families from all over the surrounding hills were invited to visit the body of Sakima but also to enjoy the good food and the company of their neighbors.

A high platform constructed from reed was raised within the ceremonial grounds and the beloved shaman was placed upon it. His body was anointed with strongly-scented oils and adorned with the wampum he wore throughout his lifetime. The platform where he rested stood six feet off the ground and some of the children dared one another to climb up the sides to have a peek but when the parents saw what they were doing they scolded them harshly and reminded them to show respect. The young women arranged flower sashes all about the base of the platform. Here the shaman would lie until the elders decided it was time to bury him in the ground. It was the same for every great man.

Roasting spits were planted near the bonfire and skewered with deer, pigs, rabbits and other game. Long tables were brought out and set upon them were clay bowls and pots filled with sour mashed hominy, locust-pod soup, honey, fried bean and corn bread, dried peaches, dried apples, and *kanuchi*, which is a soup made from hickory nuts. All the families of the village brought something and all were welcome to partake. Gathered they numbered in the hundreds.

Mika walked among them. He was alone and tried to stay invisible, though it was hard. He did not like to be consoled for the loss of his father. He did not like to be reminded what a great man Sakima was. He even avoided his mother because of the way she now looked at him. Those sad eyes, filled with pity, he could not stand it.

He found a hidden spot, away from the crowd, and sat upon a log there to watch them. They were kind people who meant well. He did not resent them. He wanted only to be left alone. His thoughts turned to the ancient tree in the shadow of the bonfire flames. There it loomed over them all. Ignored but happy to be ignored. Just like him. 

Then Mika recalled the last words his father had spoken to him and wondered what they could mean. He wished the ghost of his father would visit him in his dreams and tell him what they meant and what to do about them. Why he must do that particular thing. But he knew such things did not happen. Only in stories did they happen.

At the edge of the bonfire flames he spotted his friend Tye. He  longed to run up to his friend and joke like they always did yet he knew it was not appropriate here. Tye was a hunter like Mika and it did not take him long to spot his friend hidden in the darkness. Tye was savvy and did not approach his friend in mourning. Instead he made a gesture by interlocking his two forefingers like a chain, a secret symbol of their friendship. Mika returned the gesture from his spot on the log. His true friend.

Yet someone else had discovered him there in the shadows of the bonfire light and approached him from behind, in secret. Leoti emerged carrying a small bowl of food. Her hair was braided and hung gracefully over the shoulder. She was beautiful indeed. The last time Mika had seen her was the night his father died. She was part of the group of girls who chanted with the turtle shell rattles outside the house. Leoti placed the bowl on the ground in front of him and demurred in respectful silence. Mika gazed upon her and then glanced at the bowl, steam rising from it.

You must eat, she said.

He picked up the bowl and drank the soup down with only a few gulps. Kanuchi was one of his favorites. She then placed a wrapped cloth full of bread and roasted deer meat next to the bowl. Still warm and grease seeping through the material.

Eat, Mika.

He noticed she did not try to console him though he could see the pity in her eyes. He unraveled the cloth and ate. His mood changed as the food restored energy to his body. The meat was good. The bread was good too. He had not realized how hungry he was.

Thank you, Leoti.

She smiled and they sat together for awhile. Mika was happy she was here. He looked at all the people and for the first time that evening understood that it was love that had brought them together and that it was something not to take for granted. And he felt it himself and no longer wanted to be alone.

The elders of the tribe then gathered around the fire and the people gathered around them and sat on the ground. Mika and Leoti came closer and found a place next to the others. Then, in turn, each of the village elders told stories about Sakima the shaman. As he listened Mika was filled with such pride at the things they said. Half of the stories he had never heard before.

At last Kulsathee rose from his spot in the center of the group of elders, a large rotund man the same age as his father. He was what they called the *Chief of Peace* and had been the leader of the tribe ever since before Mika was born. There were deep lines in his face and when he smiled, which he did often, the lines grew deeper still, like bunched up leather.

The old Kulsathee told a story of how he and Sakima were out hunting one day, far away from the village, when they were just boys. Far away, he repeated. Many weeks. They were hunting bison  in the plains and decided to explore the valleys of the Southern Mountains. He spread his arms around him. 

These green valleys, he said. How we loved them. We found deer and pigs, squirrels and turkey. And then my good friend, Sakima the brave, he took a walk by himself one morning in a dense fog and discovered our tree by accident. Kulsathee gestured toward its dead, ancient branches and everyone looked at it.

Sakima discovered the tree and had a vision that misty morning. He foresaw that our people would establish a village here on this same spot. So we returned and told the elders what we had found and about the vision Sakima had been given. But the elders laughed at Sakima and called him just a boy. The next year was the bloody war among the plains people and we were uprooted, our homes burned, our crops destroyed. We traveled here as it seemed a safe haven from the death and desolation of the plains. From that point on his visions were respected and he became shaman.

The old *Chief of Peace* continued to tell stories of Sakima well into the morning. He told of the establishment of the tribe in the hills around. He told of the first council that united the neighboring tribes together. And when he was done there were tears in his eyes and the people watching were amazed as they had never seen him show emotion as he did that night.

It was then, in the lull between speakers, that Mika felt compelled to rise and tell the crowd about what his father had said to him just before his death. He rose and approached the center of the circle near the flames of the bonfire. No one said anything when they saw him approach. Kulsathee walked up to the young boy and held both of his arms in the gesture of great kinship, and then sat down with the others.

Mika stood before the people with his head bowed. Moments went by in complete silence as he collected his thoughts. Then he raised his head and observed them all. He looked into their eyes. Each one of them. They were expectant and hopeful. They wanted to hear something about his father, to inspire them. To let them know it was okay for a great man to die. Yet Mika did not speak. The words his father had spoken to him that night in the sweat house was not for them. What had been asked of him was not for them to know and that it would be a betrayal to the memory of his father to utter them to those whom it had not been given. He now understood.

The people stirred and wanted him to say something yet Mika remained silent. Some in the crowd laughed it off as youthful shyness. Some took it as pride on his part and wrinkled their noses in disgust before returning to see if there was anything good left to eat. Some pitied him. Some said he was not the man his father was.

Those were the days of abundance when the meadows in the valley turned green and blossomed with wildflowers and berries. A myriad of colors replaced the grays and browns of Winter. The river which ran through the village and irrigated their crops glistened in those mild afternoons. The women went daily along its banks and pulled trout from traps they built in the small cascades. Those fish they would barbecue that same evening to feed their families for supper. There was no need to salt them for storage during this time of the year.

The men hunted game in the nearby forests or busied themselves with construction that had been put off during the cold season. They fixed leaky roofs and erected summer shelters that allowed the breeze to blow through. This work they did communally from shared materials, harvested and stored in a building on the Northern side of the village. 

The young children ran in the fields and played games in the woods like hide and seek. They went shirtless and ate strawberries and blackberries until their mouths and fingers were stained purple. 

The older children collected in a wide open area on the Southern edge of the village grounds. There a field had been cleared of all shrubs and grass so that only a dirt floor remained. Over the years it had been hardened by the weather and by their footsteps. Here they played dice and ball games. Stick ball was popular when there were many in the group, but the game that required the most skill and therefore attracted the attention of even the elders was *tchungkee*. 

Tchungkee was a game for hunters since it required the use of a spear. There was a stone disc about the size of a grapefruit, polished smooth, with two concave indentations carved into opposite sides. This caused the disc to roll in unpredictable patterns. Two competitors lined up at the edge of a small arena whose boundaries were marked with rocks. The roller would stand between the boys and let out of a *yip* as he tossed the disc hard into the arena. The boys with the spears then had only a few seconds to gauge where they thought the disc would end up and throw their spears. Whoever threw nearest to the place where the disc ended up got the point.

This game was so popular the elders gathered under the shade of the trees that ran along the dirt arena. They brought their pipes and blankets and gambled with each other about who would win and by how many points. They all had their favorites but by far the most favored was Mika the son of Sakima, since he had the most steady throw and consistently scored more points than any of the other boys.

On this day they had already played for hours and Mika was indeed  ahead of the others in points, and yet not as much as usual, so much that some of the elders who regularly bet on his wide spread were now losing and whenever he looked over there he could see them frowning and waving their hands in frustration.

The reason for his unusually bad performance was that all afternoon his attention had been drawn to the distant Northern mountains that could be seen from here. They were not visible from within the village gates. It was only from here, in the arena clearing, that he could see those rocky ridges so far away. Once more Mika was reminded of the words of his father had spoken to him on his deathbed. He became distracted and threw his spear off the mark.

His opponent in this match, a poor player named Mohe, was excited and ran to the place his spear had landed and counted how many notches he was to the disc. Four two Mika’s seven. He had won by three points. Mika walked to his spear which stuck in the dirt a few feet from the disc. Mohe was thrilled by his score and shouted to the others to make sure everyone saw and that the scorekeeper had marked it down accurately.

Mika pulled his spear and walked to the side of the arena and sat down. His friend Tye approached.

The old men say your spear must be bad for you to be throwing like this. They say to me, Tye give him yours and he will win again.

Old buzzards, Mika said, don’t they have anything else to do? Like smoke their pipes or take cat naps.

They are worried about their bets, that’s all.

Tye looked towards the field and saw Mohe was trying to get the attention of a group of girls who sat in a circle under a tree, sewing bead necklaces. Leoti was among them. She glanced back towards Mika and Tye.

Mohe is fond of Leoti. Are you going to let that happen?

I don’t care.

His friend dropped his own spear in front of Mika.

Use mine. Challenge him again. I want to see the look on his face when you prove it was just bad luck.

Mika looked at his friend.

My spear is good. See for yourself.

Tye picked up the spear and examined it. He felt the leather straps and ran his hand along the spine, looking for imperfections.

He agreed. Your spear is good. No splinters. No warp. But how did you lose to Mohe?

I tell you my head is not right. I cannot stop thinking about my father.

His friend nodded. Tye’s brother had died in a hunting accident two summers ago so he understood loss.

It will get better, Tye said. He rose and clasped on hand on his friend’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes. You are the best tchungkee thrower of them all.

Tye left to join a game of dice across the field but then shouted over his shoulder, Except for me!

Mika grinned.

Soon another round of tchungkee started and Mohe took the lead in points since Mika did not feel like playing anymore. His friends were disappointed. The gambling elders gave up on him and placed their bets on Mohe instead. Mika watched the game from the sidelines for awhile longer then went to find his mother.

Ama was outside their summer house teaching a group of young girls how to flesh deer hides for tanning. She was old but still strong. When she scraped the broad flint blade across a hide draped along a flat wooden incline she moved like a woman twenty years younger than she was. The girls each took turns and were not nearly as quick and efficient as Ama, but they were learning and Mika’s mother was patient with them.

When she saw her son approach she wiped her hands on a cloth and embraced him. That look of pity she always gave him was present and though Mika still resented it he wanted her counsel.

Mama, I am sad.

Let us talk, his mother said. 

She told the girls to keep up the work and to finish the hide they were working on and then they could take a break. This renewed their enthusiasm.

Mika and Ama walked together along the road that led out of the village. The gates were open this time of year. From here they could hear the children playing in the arena, their laughter.

Why are you not in the arena with your friends?

I was there. I lost to Mohe.

Is that why you are sad?

No, mama.

Of course it isn’t. Ama looked at him with understanding. Now tell me what is wrong, my son.

Mika was upset to the point of tears. He wondered if he should tell his mother everything, her eyes so full of compassion. She wanted him to be happy. But he could not tell her. Not even her.

Father asked something of me, the night of his death, a thing I must do. So I tell myself Mika this thing can wait. There is time enough to do it later. But when I try to enjoy the things I did before it is there and there is no joy in those things anymore.

Mika stopped in the road and his mother did the same. He looked towards the far mountains partially hidden by the hills. His mother followed his eyes but did not speak or asked him why he looked there.

I want to play games with my friends again. I want it to be like it was before when life was fun and carefree. Now there is always the voice of my father. It pulls me away from them.

Ama reached out and feathered the hair that fell into Mika’s eyes. This show of tenderness caused a tear to fall and he was ashamed because that was not a thing men did.

Look at me, Mika.

He did so.

My son, your heart is divided. You must do what it asks of you or there will be no end to your suffering. Do not be afraid. Your friends will still be here. You will play games with them again. Like it was before. But first you must find peace within you.

Is all that true? Mika asked. His eyes lifted and he smiled.

Yes it is.

Mika and his mother embraced and then returned inside the gates of the village. The late afternoon sun shone through the gate poles and lit geometrical shapes onto the path where they walked. It was time for supper and in the air was an aroma of fresh barbecued fish and bread baking on the fire.

~

Before light Mika rose. He was careful not to wake his mother who slept next to him. In the darkness of morning he found his knife and the sheathe with a strap to go around his shoulder. Ama the night before had prepared some fried bread cakes, good food for travel, and wrapped them in a thin cloth. He put those in a satchel also strapped around his shoulder. There was no need to take any water as he would be following the river and could drink from it whenever he was thirsty.

There was an old bucket in the storage shed his father had used. Most of the contents of the shed were now dispersed to others in the tribe, but nobody had yet found a need for this bucket, and Mika was happy to find it there just as he remembered.

With these few items he stepped on the path that headed outside the Northern gate. His good friend Gawoni stood guard that morning and Mika found him snoring under the platform built for archers.

Let me out you lazy dog, Mika said. 

He gave his friend a soft kick in the side and Gawoni startled awake. Mika laughed.

Why do you laugh? Gawoni said. He stretched both arms above him and yawned like a mountain lion. I was awake.

Again Mika asked his friend to open the gate. Gawoni, when his eyes adjusted to the dim light of morning, gave Mika a strange look.

Where are you going so early in the morning?

To do what my father asked of me.

But where?

To the mountains in the north.

Why must you do this thing?

I was not told why. I was only told what to do.

What is the bucket for?

That I do know but I cannot tell you. Please don't be angry.

Gawoni sighed. It was much too early for this so he swung open one of the wooden gates just enough for Mika to pass.

You are a strange one, Mika. Safe travels.

Mika walked outside and heard the gate shut behind him. He turned to see Gawoni returning to his napping spot under the platform.

So long, Gawoni.

Do me a favor. When you return make sure it is after sunrise.

Now that he was alone it was not so bad. The dirt path ended not too far away from the village and then there was just the river to guide him. But it was a fine guide. The directions clear. When the morning sun appeared over the hills it reflected off of the surface of the water and shined into his eyes. He shielded them and kept walking.

Once he left the valley he came to a wide plain. Here for the first time he had a clear view of the far mountains. The peaks of it were covered in snow.

But though he was away from the village, away from his friends and all the people that loved him, finally there was a calm inside him. He did not think of the words of his father now. He had no need to. 

The bucket he carried in his left hand started to blister the palms so he switched it to the right. But then after an hour it began to blister the right and he switched again. This time there was no avoiding the blisters and he knew when the skin broke because it was a sharp pain now.

His legs hurt. His back was sore. He rested in a field of tall grass. He went to the river bank and dunked his head under. The cold revitalized him. He cupped some water and drank it down. Then he sat in the grass and ate a few pieces of the fried bread. His energy returned.

That is enough progress for today, he said aloud. Now I will rest for tomorrow.

He kindled a fire in the grass and watched the sun go down and the stars emerge in the heavens. So bright they were that night because it was the new moon. Then he lay in the grass and fell asleep almost immediately. He did not dream and did not open his eyes once until the morning sun rose over the horizon and illuminated the plains.

He held one arm over his eyes to shield himself from the low sunrise. Its radiance warmed his skin and dried up the dew on the grass within the hour.

Mika had thought the nights rest would heal the soreness in his legs and back and make the blisters on his palms better. But it was worse today. He walked slower but made progress.

You are soft, Mika, he scolded himself, and this deed is not for boys.

He wrapped the handle of the bucket with blades of grass to make it softer but it helped little. They bled and the pain from them was nearly constant. He had to stop for rest more often on the second day. He ate more of the food. Indeed there was not much of it left, but that was no matter. When he stopped for the day he caught a fish in the river with some line he brought in the satchel and cooked it over the fire. Again he felt his strength return.

Three more days passed in the same way. The soreness did not get better but he did get better at living with it. Now in the distance he could see the end of the plains because there were hills and the grass became more sparse. 

But he was lonely. He missed the people from his tribe. Missed seeing them each morning. He missed his friends. He missed his mother. He thought of them always. What they were doing. What gossip there was. What they were eating for supper. He even missed Mohe. When he returned he would challenge him to a round and show him what’s what. These thoughts passed the time but they made him very lonely and especially at night when there was nothing else around to distract him.

After the third day the fried bread ran out and he relied on the fish in the river alone to nourish him. He made steady progress even as the landscape inclined. But on the third night he caught no fish, there were none, and that night he went to bed hungry and woke up the next morning with no strength even to fish let alone continue his journey.

How weak I am, Mika said aloud, what would my father say if he could see me now? My last request was wasted on you. You are not ready. You cry like a baby because your feet hurt and your palms bleed. Shameful.

Mika lay in the grass feeling ashamed and hungry and lonely for his tribe. He was so hungry. Just a little nourishment and he would be fine again. He could continue. Where were the fish? Why could he not catch a single one? He sat up and looked towards the far mountains. So far away they were. They did not look any closer than when he first began. The day ended and he had not made any progress and was low in spirit. He slept with no fire that night.
