Some animals were coveted not for their meat but for their fur, or for some portion of their anatomy that could yield an article of clothing or some domestic item. Chief among these were the five varieties of the North American wolf (grey, white, pied, dusky, and black); the coyote or prairie wolf; the fox and Arctic fox; the wolverine; and the raccoon. There were also a host of more humble animals almost too numerous to mention. Among them were the rabbit, weasel, ermine, mink, marten, badger, skunk, squirrel, chipmunk, gopher, prairie dog, marmot, beaver, porcupine, and the rat and mouse.
