The hunter and the bear went together and came to a hole in the side of the mountain. "This is where I live", said the bear, and they went inside. By this time the hunter was very hungry and was wondering how he could get something to eat. The other knew his thoughts, and sitting up on his hind legs he rubbed his stomach with his forepaws - just so - and at once he had both paws full of chestnuts and gave them to the man. He rubbed his stomach again - just so - and had his paws full of huckleberries, and gave them to the man. He rubbed again - just so - and gave the man paws full of blackberries. He rubbed again - just so - and had his paws full of acorns, but the man said he could not eat them. He was full.

The hunter lived in the cave all winter with the bear, until hair like a bear began to grow all over his body and he began even to act like a bear; but he still walked like a man.
