I am weary of fighting. Our chiefs are killed. Looking Glass is dead. Toohoolhoolzote is dead. The old men are all dead. It is now the young men who say 'yay' or 'nay', and he who used to lead them, my brother Olicut, is dead. It is cold. We have no blankets. The children are freezing. Some of my people have taken to the hills, and have no covering and no food. No one knows where they are. Perhaps they too are freezing. I want to look for them and try to fin them. Perhaps they are dead. Hear me, my chiefs. I am tired. My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.
