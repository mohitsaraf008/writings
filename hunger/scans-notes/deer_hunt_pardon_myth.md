Whenever the hunter shoots a deer, the Little Deer (Awi Usdi), who is swift as the wind and cannot be wounded, runs quickly up to the spot and, bending over the bloodstains, asks the spirit of the slain deer if has heard the prayer of the hunter for pardon. If the reply be 'yes' then all is well and the Little Deer goes on his way, but if the reply be 'no' the Little Deer will follow on the trail of the hunter, guided by the drops of blood and will strike the hunter with rheumatism so that he becomes a helpless cripple.

If you forget then you may try to build a fire in the path to attempt to throw off the trail of Little Deer.

When the redroot (Ceanothus americanus) puts forth its leaves the people say the young fawns are then in the mountains. On killing a deer the hunter always cuts out the hamstring from the hind quarter and throws it away, for fear that if he ate it he would thereafter tire easily in traveling.
