Songs intended to call up the deer or the bear.

They were sung by the hunter, with some accompanying ceremony, in a sweetly plaintive tune, either before starting out or on reaching the hunting ground.

O Deer, you stand close by the tree,
You sweeten your saliva with acorns,
Now you are standing near,
You have come where your food rests on the ground.

Somewhere (the deer) lies on the ground, I think; I walk about.
  Awake, arise, stand up!
It is raising up its head, I believe; I walk about.
  Awake, arise, stand up!
It attempts to rise, I believe; I walk about.
  Awake, arise, stand up!
Slowly it raises its body, I think; I walk about.
  Awake, arise, stand up!
It has now risen on its feet, I presume; I walk about.
  Awake, arise, stand up!
