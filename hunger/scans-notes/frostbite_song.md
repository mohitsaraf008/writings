In a characteristic song formula to prevent frostbite the traveler, before starting out on a cold winter morning, rubs his feet in the ashes of the fire and sings a song of four verses, by means of which, according to the Indian idea, he acquires in turn the cold-defying powers of the wolf, deer, fox, and opossum, four animals whose feet, it is held, are never frostbitten. After each verse he imitates the cry and the action of the animal:

Tsun wa yaya (x4), wa....a! (howl, then paws at the ground like a wolf)

Tsun ka wiye (x4), sauh! sauh! sauh! sauh! (imitates the jumping of a deer)

Tsun tsu laya (x4), gaih! gaih! gaih! gaih! (imitates the barking/scratching of a fox)

Tsun si kwaya (x4), ki.....ki (imitates the cry of the opossum, and playing dead)
