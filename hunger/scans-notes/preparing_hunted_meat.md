Fish, flesh or fowl, a part of the hunt that was as important as the chase was the division of the spoils. This was a serious matter, in which tradition and tribal and family relationships played a key part. Small animals could be taken back to camp and divided up at leisure, but larger ones had to be dressed out on the spot. The slayer, who recognized the beast he had killed by his personal markings on the arrow that slew it, claimed the best portions, bestowing other portions on those who had assisted him with the kill. Certain portions were set aside for specific people, or for religious purposes. After the butchering, and the removal and preliminary scraping of the hides, the meat was reduced to manageable amounts, which in turn were strapped inside rawhide containers, like skin tarpaulins, or parfleches. The parfleches were carried on travois or on the backs of the huntsmen to the temporary camps, then to the main camp.

Often the women and children would make their way to the place of the kill, to help with this labour. It had to be done quickly and skillfully, otherwise the precious meat would spoil. If the meat was abundant, or there was too much of it, the tribe would hold a feast on the spot, before reducing the rest to 'jerky' or pemmican.

Cherokee traditions after killing a deer

After killing a deer the hunter should cut out the hamstrings and leave them behind. He should not leave them in the meat. He should also not leave without offering a prayer for pardon to the deer. He should use the tip of the deer's tongue as an offering of thanks by putting it in the fire. It is also common for people to throw some of the meat from every meal to the fire as an offering of thanks.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemmican

Pemmican is a concentrated mixture of fat and protein used as a nutritious food. The word comes from the Cree word pimîhkân, which itself is derived from the word pimî, "fat, grease".[1] It was invented by the native peoples of North America.[2][3] It was widely adopted as a high-energy food by Europeans involved in the fur trade and later by Arctic and Antarctic explorers, such as Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen.

The specific ingredients used were usually whatever was available; the meat was often bison, moose, elk, or deer. Fruits such as cranberries and saskatoon berries were sometimes added. Cherries, currants, chokeberries and blueberries were also used, but almost exclusively in ceremonial and wedding pemmican.[4]

Traditional preparation[edit]

Ball of pemmican
Traditionally, pemmican was prepared from the lean meat of large game such as buffalo, moose, elk or deer. The meat was cut in thin slices and dried over a slow fire, or in the hot sun until it was hard and brittle. About five pounds of meat are required to make one pound of dried meat suitable for pemmican. Then it was pounded into very small pieces, almost powder-like in consistency, using stones. The pounded meat was mixed with melted fat in an approximate 1:1 ratio.[5] In some cases, dried fruits, such as saskatoon berries, cranberries, blueberries, or choke cherries, were pounded into powder and then added to the meat/fat mixture. The resulting mixture was then packed into rawhide bags for storage.

A bag of buffalo pemmican weighing about 90 lb (41 kg) was called a taureau (French for "bull") by the Métis of Red River. These bags of taureaux (lit. ‘bulls’) when mixed with fat from the udder were known as taureaux fins, when mixed with bone marrow as taureaux grand and when mixed with berries as taureaux à grains.[6] It generally took the meat of one buffalo to fill a taureau.[7]

Serving[edit]
In his notes of 1874, North-West Mounted Police Sergent-Major Sam Steele records three ways of serving pemmican: raw; boiled in a stew called "rubaboo"; or fried, known in the West as a "rechaud" [1]

"The pemmican was cooked in two ways in the west; one a stew of pemmican, water, flour and, if they could be secured, wild onions or preserved potatoes. This was called 'rubaboo'; the other was called by the plains hunters a 'rechaud'. It was cooked in a frying pan with onions and potatoes or alone. Some persons ate pemmican raw, but I must say I never had a taste for it that way." (Sam Steele 1874)[8]

History[edit]
See also: Métis buffalo hunt § Pemmican trade
The voyageurs of the Canadian fur trade had no time to live off the land during the short season when the lakes and rivers were free of ice. They had to carry their food with them and if the distance travelled was great be resupplied along the way.[9] A north canoe (canot du nord) with six men and 25 standard 90 lb (41 kg) packs required about four packs of food per 500 miles (800 km). Montreal-based canoemen could be supplied by sea or with locally grown food. Their main food was dried peas or beans, sea biscuit and salt pork. (Western canoemen called their Montreal-based fellows mangeurs de lard or "pork-eaters".) In the Great Lakes some maize and wild rice could be obtained locally. By the time trade reached the Winnipeg area the pemmican trade was developed.[9]

Métis would go southwest onto the prairie in Red River carts, slaughter buffalo, convert it into pemmican and carry it north to trade at the North West Company posts. For these people on the edge of the prairie the pemmican trade was as important a source of trade goods as was the beaver trade for the Indians further north. This trade was a major factor in the emergence of a distinct Métis society. Packs of pemmican would be shipped north and stored at the major fur posts: Fort Alexander, Cumberland House, Île-à-la-Crosse, Fort Garry, Norway House, and Edmonton House. So important was pemmican that, in 1814, governor Miles Macdonell started the Pemmican War with the Métis when he passed the short-lived Pemmican Proclamation, which forbade the export of pemmican from the Red River Colony.[10]

Alexander Mackenzie relied on pemmican on his 1793 expedition across Canada to the Pacific.[11]

North Pole explorer Robert Peary used pemmican on all three of his expeditions, from 1886 to 1909, for both his men and his dogs. In his 1917 book Secrets of Polar Travel, he devoted several pages to the food, stating, "Too much cannot be said of the importance of pemmican to a polar expedition. It is an absolute sine qua non. Without it a sledge-party cannot compact its supplies within a limit of weight to make a serious polar journey successful."[12]

British polar expeditions fed a type of pemmican to their dogs as "sledging rations". Called "Bovril pemmican" or simply "dog pemmican", it was a beef product consisting of 2/3 protein and 1/3 fat, without carbohydrate. It was later ascertained that although the dogs survived on it, this was not a nutritious and healthy diet for them, being too high in protein.[13] Members of Ernest Shackleton's 1914–1916 expedition to the Antarctic resorted to eating dog pemmican when they were stranded on ice for the winter.[14]

During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), British troops were given an iron ration made of four ounces of pemmican and four ounces of chocolate and sugar. The pemmican would keep in perfect condition for decades. It was considered much superior to biltong, a form of cured game meats commonly used in Africa. This iron ration was prepared in two small tins (soldered together) which were fastened inside the soldiers' belts. It was the last ration used and it was used only as a last resort---when ordered by the commanding officer. A man could march on this for 36 hours before he began to drop from hunger.[15]

American adventurer Frederick Russell Burnham, while serving as Chief of Scouts for the British Army in South Africa, required pemmican to be carried by every scout.[16]

In the book Hearne describes many instances of himself and his North Indian companions relying on pemmican as their only food for extended periods of time during their travels. According to Hearne the North Indians in his company would, when being in an area with large amounts of game, make a habit of stopping to hunt large amount of game in order to prepare as much pemmican as could be carried. If their stocks of pemmican was already full the Indians would often still kill as much big game as possible but only take and eat the marrow-bones, fat and tongue while the rest of the animal was left behind.
