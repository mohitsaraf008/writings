Skins were treated in a variety of ways. Left untanned, as rawhide, with the hair and flesh removed, they were as tough as bone or plastic, and provided war-shields, bindings, and parfleches. The skins of buffalo, elk, moose, deer, antelope and other animals could be turned into the softest leather.

After being wrung dry and stretched over a frame, it was ready for cutting and sewing into clothes, bags, pouches, shirts, leggings, footwear, arrow-cases...etc.

The Crows of the Plains, for example, made their skin clothes and tipis so perfectly that after a rainstorm they dried out rapidly and with no sign of damage.

A leather garment or other item was seldom left plain. It was fringed, embroidered, painted, or embellished with beadwork, shellwork, quillwork, or feathers. In addition to leatherwork, other articles of dress were fashioned by weaving, either by means of simple finger-weaving, twining, plaiting, and braiding, or employing the belt-loom or the true loom. Shirts, dresses, belts, sashes, chief's blankets, shoulder blankets, ponchos, and other articles were all made by Indian weavers. As for the children, they usually ran about naked until the age of five or six, when they were put into their first clothes.

Normally, great attention was paid to making sure shoes were kept on, since there was a constant danger of rattlesnakes, ants, and other creatures. Indians possessed several pairs of moccasins, some with high tops and some with low, some with hard soles and some with soft, some for idling about in and others for farming, working, tacking, and hunting.
