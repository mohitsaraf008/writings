In one place, just under the ground, the Red Man found a scale of the Uktena. Next he went over to a tree that had been struck by lightning and gathering splinters from it made a fire, whereupon he burned the uktena scale to a coal. He wrapped the coal inside a deerskin and gave it to the hunter, saying "As long as you keep this you can always kill game". Then he told the hunter when he went back to camp he must hang up the medicine on a tree outside, because it was very strong and dangerous. He told him also that when he went into the cabin he would find his brother lying inside nearly dead on account of the presence of the scale, but he must take a small piece of cane, which the Red Man gave him, and scrape a little of it into water and give it to his brother to drink and he would be well again. Then the Red Man was gone, and the hunter could not see where he went. He returned to camp and all was as the mysterious man had told him.
