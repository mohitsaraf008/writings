When a band began to swell in size, and approached the 200 mark, the problem of feeding it became serious, and the usual solution was fission. A group of families, led by a young man of exceptional character and ability, would elect to go its own way. It would thereupon hive off from the parent body. Sometimes it would do so with the blessing of its elders; sometimes it would split away as a result of a quarrel or rivalry.

In the new band, the key people were the hunters. Wissler worked out, from historical data, that the members of a band of 100 indians would require a minimum of four pounds of meat a day. This meant that the five to ten principal huntsmen of the tribe would need to kill an average of four deer or one elk each day, or three or four moose or two buffalo a week. A stiff task. As Wissler observes, 'The Indian male was not altogether a gentlemen of leisure.' No wonder that Indian boys were given their first miniature bows and arrows and their first toy spears and knives as soon as they could walk. The hunter who possessed a steady hand, a sharp eye, a swift foot, and a strong arm, was considered a superior person.

It was the practice of hunting that above everything else bestowed on the American Indian his individual and peculiar character. There were, of course, many types of Indian. The sedentary, agricultural Indian and the wild, horse Indian differed widely in outlook and temperament.
