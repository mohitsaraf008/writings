Modern technology: cars, bars, television (and yet indistinct, no computers)

Joseph finds his grandfather at rest next to a log. Sits on his lap. They stare at the water for a long time. His grandfather presses his cheek against his own. Body odor and stale beer, sweat.

"What do you feel?"

“Whiskers."

"No. What do you feel?"

"Love."

"He ain't coming back, Joseph. I need you to understand that."
"He is."

"Said your daddy was a sorry son of a bitch. Left yall. Now you gotta live behind that abandoned trailer park, in a shack like hillbillies."
"Fuck you, you motherfucker! I'll kick your fuckin ass!"

A new knife.
"What did I ask you to do?"
"Tell no one."

"If you talk about it, it goes away."
"What does?"

"Why did he leave us?"
"I don't know, Joseph. I wish I did."

Grandfather in the early stages of dementia, cold house, wakes up early and fires up furnace.

A feeling of nature


What is the narrative pull?

  The visitor, the scene with the dog has already happened.
  Jacob, Minister retells the story.
  Invites them to the Fall Festival.
  "You're not like them other boys," he spoke, "Your heart is good."
  "I understand you."
  "Yes. I see by your eyes that you do."

Joseph sat on the porch and gazed down the dirt road. A man appeared from behind a row of pines that canopied the dirt road. They all came that way, car parked at the edge where it was still paved, where the mailboxes were. There was idle talk of pitching in and graveling it or maybe even getting the county to pave it one of these days. But that was just talk. There was no money for such things. Not anymore.

"Well, I'll be."

There coming up the road, the shadow of a man, familiar to him.

Punished after learning about how they tortured the dog, along with some other boys from the neighborhood.
Has to go work for Minister Jacob each afternoon with the others. Arrives at work to find the minister's chickens have been killed.
"Well, shit. Goddamn!" "Sorry, boys. I'm so sorry."
"Might could be that stray dog."

The large story outside the main, not well understood by Joseph. A corruption in the church, an affair, a murder, skipping town with the money raised to rebuild their house. A fire.

At the funeral:
There ain't no more money, darlin. We did what we could, you know, but circumstances change. You understand. Times are hard for everybody. You ain't the only ones. In this economy. You'll be fine. And you're always welcome at the congregation. Jacob was a charismatic man. But he turned out rotten. They found him in a hotel in Alabama, shot himself. Good lord.

What's going to happen to us?
I don't know, baby.
Goddamn this world.

A promise, many promises built on other promises.

Joseph picks up his grandfather's morning chores, following the funeral, lighting the furnace.


The father returns home at the end of the book, in the morning, lights the furnace, sits on the porch and looks towards the road, mirroring when Joseph cleaned the room for his brother.

Grandfather confuses Joseph for Will, his son. Tells him to return.


Like most mornings Joseph sat alone on the porch, feet dangling from a rocking chair that no longer worked because one of the rockers broke off, the wood dry and old, brittle. Grandpa determined to fix it one day, "By God", with an old tire tread cut into a crescent and some baling wire, and it still didn't rock. But at least you could sit in it. And grandpa was proud of his ingenuity and tried to work it into conversations not remotely about rocking chairs.

He liked to sit out there because you could see a long way, clear to the mountain ridge somedays, blue and shadowy in the distance.



Outline
===============

JOSEPH THE SON

Grandfather wakes before everyone else, lights the stove to warm the house, makes coffee in percolator, biscuits with karo syrup, bacon. Watches the sun come up through the window. Intro to knife. Grandpa calls Joseph Will. Joseph and his sister off to school. Mother sleeps in, night shift.

Walking home with boys from school. The dog. Minister Jacob. Chickens.

A visit by Minister Jacob. Joseph gazes lovingly through the outside window at his family indoors, where it was warm. Decorating a small pine with popcorn. A longing deep within. Something so far away from him. Tears came to his eyes. He somehow knew it would always be so. That it was not something he could possess. And it filled his heart with sadness. At least that was how his mind understood it. Invited to Fall Festival Sermon.

That he would lose it over and over again. Florene. If I only understood what it meant to lose my love to eternity. I lost her. Every moment I didn’t want to be in her presence. I remember a summer night I left the house and went for a walk and I cursed her. And now what I wouldn’t give. It doesn’t matter. Nothing else matters. Nothing! That’s what they don’t tell you about life. That all the rest is horseshit. Your job, money, house, car. Horseshit. They don’t tell you that and then by the time you finally understand its too late. Love. More real than those things. I can’t say what I mean. I won’t never again be that boy who got up courage to ask her to go with me to the Shannon barn dance and took her outside and kissed her under the stars that night. She was my love. Mine. 

And there ain’t no Heaven. No after life. No reunification will bring that love back to me again. Don’t bullshit me.

“All of creation is our brothers and sisters, but more than that even. The fingers and toes and arms and legs and torso of one heavenly body. Did you know Saint Assisi called the sun his brother? That is the truth. We must have compassion for them. We must forbear when they do wrong. Mutual reverence for the life, God given.”

“I understand you.” Joseph said.

Jacob paused, glanced to the other boys, disinterested and impatient, and then back to Joseph. 

“Yes,” he placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. “I see by your eyes that you do.”

Work Day One: At work on Jacob’s farm.
	Jesse calls his father ‘left yall. just a no account asshole. and you and your brother are just a bunch of bastards.’
	Joseph lashes out but gets his ass kicked
	Work is tearing down trees to build a garden.

The family goes to Cornucopia. Fundraiser.
	Sermon
	Country Feast (Rich cinnamon apple pies)
	Jacob is inspired to restore the old house they live in

Work Day Two: The dead chickens are discovered. Jacob asks Joseph in secret to discover the culprit, with his brother. Joseph asks Jacob to dinner, on behalf of mother. “No work ethic, them boys. When you old like me you understand the value of work. Doing your part.” 

Look, you’ve done your part here, I guess. More than them other boys anyway. Find out what killed my chickens this morning. I’ll pay you well if you find out what killed them for me. Even more if you catch that sucker.” 

Joseph figured it was probably that old dog from the other day, but he didn’t say a word, and neither did Jacob. They just looked at one another with an understanding that made him uneasy.

“Sure, I can do that.”

“Get your sister to help you, even.”

“Yeah.”

Minister Jacob comes over for dinner. Argument with grandpa. There is no God. Drunk.

Jacob at Dinner table: The heart deceives. A common belief. Yet I am not so sure. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. So, you see. The capacity to judge right and wrong is inside every person. If this were not so then there would be no golden rule.

Lizzie to Jacob, “You’re bald.”
“That’s why I wear this hat. You like it?”

Grandfather whips Noah and Joseph cleans the room, and waits patiently for the sun to rise.

Joseph and his brother look for clues on Jacob’s farm. Joseph receives a new knife, told not to tell anyone. Maybe this will help you on your quest.

Grandfather takes Joseph and Noah out to feed the horses apples, fence breaks. We can fix it tomorrow.

Grandfather gives Joseph the old knife he wanted. “Come back to your family, Will. They need you now. That precious boy needs you.” Joseph cries. “I’m Joseph.” “I know that.”

That’s his way of apologizing. “Your daddy ain’t coming back, Joseph.” “He is.”

Buries the new one he received from Minister Jacob in shame. In the ground, in the dirt where it would stay forever.

Joseph and Noah trace the tracks to an old barn. Jason and other boys have already found the culprit, the old dog. Joseph defends it by repeating what Jacob told them all about God’s grace. They tell him Jacob paid them to hang it for killing the chickens. Joseph is struck by Jesse but does not retaliate. His strength in non-retaliation earns their respect. Sister cries. They keep the dog.

Mother is crying. They somehow overhear the Minister has killed the junior pastor at the behest of the secretary who he was having an affair with. On the run with money they had raised to fix Joseph family’s roof. $8000 total.

Joseph tends to his dog in a makeshift dog house. “You are mine forever.” The dog runs off, past the field, into the woods. Joseph follows him. Ends up at a lake. His grandfather is there. He sits on his lap. “Minister Jacob ran off with the money. He killed a man.” “It doesn’t matter.” “What do you feel?” “Whiskers.” “No. What do you feel?” “Love.”

“Joseph, your grandfather has passed away.”

Funeral. The first snow is falling. Buried next to his love. They learn Jacob shot himself in a Motel 6 outside Birmingham. Left a note that said, “Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do.”

Consoles his mother. “Who was that evil man, Jacob? I invited him into our home. I can’t do this alone. I can’t do it. I give up.” “You’re not alone.” Stokes the fire and it burns until the small hours of the morning.

In the early morning hours, Will enters the house, using an old key. He brings in wood for the stove and kindles it. Make a pot of coffee, and waits for the sun to rise.


Main Characters
===================

Joseph - Awaits the return of his father, unspoken and yet understood by all. Minister Jacob becomes father figure.

Lizzie - About five. Assumes the feelings and ideas of those around her. Joseph is protective, but annoyed by her.

Mother (Beth) - Trying to hold things together, starts a new life, falls in love with the promises that Minister Jacob makes. I give up. I don’t know what to do anymore. God damn. God damn this world.

Grandfather (Kenneth) - Living in a state of dementia. Wants to rebuild the house as it has fallen into disrepair. No belief in God, but reveals the mystery to Joseph. Beth calls him “Mr. Kenneth”.

Father (Will) - The returner.

Minister Jacob

Each of the main characters needs their own story arc, with its own rises and falls. In this book, the plot should be light and unimposing, creeping in around scenes that are more about the characters. Moments, moods, memories. Suggested rather than told.

The words that Jesus said are not true because he spoke them. Truth is not truth because who speaks the words. Lies are not lies because they come from the mouth of a liar.

The lie is not the lie because it proceeds from the mouth of a liar. The truth is not the truth because it proceeds from the mouth of a truth-teller.

Minister Jacob tells the story of the house he never built.

Important that scenes lead into one another organically, and do not seem episodic. This leads to blurred line between reality and dream later.

Minister Jacob’s hypocrisy reveals itself through the ‘fruit’ of his actions, never from his demeanor or words.

Establish early that Joseph wants the rusty old knife that sits on the shelf. Grandfather polishes it up the best he can and gives it for his birthday.

Worried about the winter. No heat. Ostracized from the church after the incident. Mother somehow implicated.

"It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what is."

Grandpa Ken: Loss
Minister Jacob: Hope

Minister Jacob offers to drive Beth to work. Uses that as a way to smuggle goods out of the church to his house.

No one at funeral. Behind the house. Hires Jesse and gang to dig. Woman comes to pay her respects, update on Jacob (suicide) and for their family not to come around for awhile.

What makes this story compelling? We follow the events through the eyes of a boy who is having to become more responsible, what he is interested in, the dog, the chickens, the knife, the bullies, his sister, snow, fall, cinnamon apples with milk, and yet in the background there is a story unfolding, Minister Jacob’s corruption of the church, Grandpa’s struggles to repair the house for Winter, Minister Jacob wooing the mother. Plot points should reveal themselves by suggestion and indirection, in the background sometimes.

Even though it deals with a minister and the church, do not get into specific Christian ideas. Keep it universal, metaphysical if you go there. It almost should not matter what religion it is.

The story seems to want to take place in an indistinct time. Don’t force the point. Have cars. Have TV. Avoid any more technology than that.

This story is a challenge because unlike your other stories, this one doesn’t have anything *big* going on in the main plotline, except for grandfather’s natural death and the murder of the youth minister, which stays background action. The trick is to make it *feel* big.

Mother cries after the funeral and Joseph consoles her. They fall asleep in Joseph’s bed.

Not in school because of ‘fall break’, an indeterminate time away from school.

Creating wealth in this world. House on a hill. Look at what it has now become. This tomb of a home. Do you think I was always wrinkled and ugly like I am now?  Do you think my mind was always slow? I was once like you. Smooth skin like Lizzie there, sharp in mind. I had money that I spent on myself and others. I was humbled to be able to give to the poor. I lorded it over those who had none while pretending to be humble.


There is a hole in the main living area. Grandpa is working on a repair. Makes more holes.

Jacob wants the boys to tear up a garden.

Will has gotten a message from Beth about his father is why he returns.


First sentence should describe dog being tortured.

The story opens on the walk home from school. They are coming home earlier in the day because of Fall break. Joseph is with a group of boys who live in the trailer park next to his house. They stop to torture a stray dog. Joseph is not reluctant to join in, even though he is not really *friends* with them. Minister Jacob is outside tending to his chickens and sees them. He steps in and censures the boys. He recognizes Joseph as someone new to the neighborhood and asks if he is from the family that just moved into the old house on the hill. When he finds out he is, he wants to speak with the Joseph’s father. Tells the other boys to get on home.


Joseph takes up Minister Jacob’s censure literally, becomes vegetarian. At the dinner Minister Jacob is eating meat. They discuss.

What passage is that?

Not from the scripture. What is a true thing?

Integration and Disintegration. Is all there is.

How do we know what is true?

Mother’s car has broken alternator. Minister Jacob takes to his house to fix. That is the car they escape in.

Grandpa is upset that Jacob is helping him. Think you’re God Almighty? How arrogant. I hate this. The conversation about vegetarianism brings in Grandpa. “It doesn’t matter what you believe. It doesn’t matter what I believe. It only matters what *is*.”

I can’t.
Why?
It’s wrong.
God placed us in this world, Joseph. It is not a sin to feed your family. We revere the animal for the life it has given up. Life must feed on life to live.
Why do you consider this chicken to be a life, and yet not a piece of fruit? It has a life.
Do you understand?
I do.
It is not for us to know God’s will.
I won’t have you come into my home and feed my family this horseshit. Lies.
They are not lies, sir.
Confusion then. Look at what you’ve done to my grandson. He can’t even eat his dinner.

If it is okay to kill animals for food then why was just messing around with an animal so bad? I don’t get it.

Jesse and Joseph get into a fight because Jesse calls him a bastard. Minister Jacob breaks it up - “He is your brother, why do you strike your brother, Joseph.”

Lizzie has a cold, perhaps pneumonia. She won’t eat.

Watches his family from outside the window. It was like five hundred years had passed. He then realized a moment in time was not something he could possess. But he felt a strong desire to possess it — to keep it with him always. H	is hand reached up to the glass. The motion caught Lizzie’s attention and she laughed and raced over to the glass and placed her hand over his, with only the pane between them.


A longing deep within. Something so far away from him. Tears came to his eyes. He somehow knew it would always be so. That it was not something he could possess. And it filled his heart with sadness. At least that was how his mind understood it.

TODO:

Work out all scenes / beats at least to the point where the plot follows.

(5000) 6: Dinner with Jacob, dancing with mother, argument with grandpa. Sent to bed, making noise (telling stories about their father, a sailor), grandfather whips Lizzie. Joseph cleans room. "Think I don't know. Think I don't know that you laugh at me. I know more than you think I do. Think I was always old? Think my mind was always confused? Once I was strong. Once I was witty. Made jokes. Once I felt pity for the aged and the poor. With a solemn and respectful face I gave money to those in need. In so many small ways I lorded it over them. All the time welling up with pride at my goodness, sometimes to the verge of tears at my benevolence. How vain I was. How useless and vain. What did I know about loss then? It all goes to shit. God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Virgin birth. Walking on water. The resurrection. That's the lie. The only truth in this world is disintegration. There will be no reunion. What is gone will not come again." 

"Respectfully sir, you are mistaken. And I've dedicated my life to sharing the Good News that has been revealed to us through the life and death of our Savior, Jesus Christ. That is my belief."

"Respectfully sir, it doesn't matter what you believe. And it doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what is."

PART TWO (22000):

(3000) 8: Car catches on fire. Something more serious this time. Jacob comes over to take a look. Will cost more to fix than the car is worth. “With the money we have raised we can buy you a new car also.” Joseph sees Jacob kissing his mother. Becomes angry.

EPILOGUE:

(1500) 14: Will returns in the middle of the night and rekindles the fire, awaits his family to awaken.




There is a mystery in the everyday. Your responsibility is to reveal that. It should not come from the flow of words, or the kind of words you use, but from the actions and words of the characters. Forget the metaphors, symbols. Evoke the scenes as if they really happened. Put yourself there. Don’t explain too much. Trust the reader to read between the lines. In fact, expect them to. It is compelling when the reader must engage like that. Also plant seeds throughout the story that sprout at different times and in different forms later. This compels the reader.

You know by this point what your strengths are. Embrace those strengths. If what you can do does not resemble what people normally consider a novel then so be it. Don’t conform to an expectation of how a story should be told. This is not arrogance if you keep humble and stay critical of what you write. If it works for you then it will work for others. Put simply, have faith. There is an invisible boundary that keeps you inside its walls. Those are the boundaries of convention and expectation. Escape. You feel them constraining what you are able to do, conceive of.

Create rounded characters. Suggest their character through description and dialogue. But do not define them to the reader.

Make it so real

The dirt road
The barn
The old house (like a tomb)
Trailer park
Field with horse / lake
Southern Baptist Church
Jacob’s Farm

The dinner: Meatloaf, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, green beans, mac and cheese. Mother whistles as she prepares meal. Wears dark red lipstick.

Beth works as cashier at the Piggly Wiggly

Unnamed North Georgia town. Will left last year. Had to move in with grandpa when he got sick. Water on the brain (Hydrocephalus) No money. Just a pager number.

Kelly and Steven Echols
Jacob Brumbalow
Beth, Joseph, Lizzie, Will, Kenneth Hight
Margaret Foy
Jesse Black

The knife: "It's awesome. It's just like the ones they sell at the flea market."

A story that on the surface seems ordinary, dull even, but as you look closer you see things aren't quite put together like you thought. There is a strangeness to it, a mystery to it all.

Keep theological discussions somewhat generic. It almost shouldn't matter that Jacob is Christian. It is more about a belief in faith, eternal life, universal brotherhood. You should be able to map theological discussions to any of the major religions. Jacob is more of a Christian Mystic, in this way. Even though the church is a Southern Baptist.

Grandpa is not well educated. Do not make him a mouthpiece for your ideas. Keep him real.


This is not a Christian story even though it deals with a Christian minister. You should be able to easily transplant the same story to Iran (Islam), India (Hinduism), or Japan (Buddhism). The fact Jacob is a Christian minister is not unimportant, but its more about his being a community moral leader, like ministers are in small southern towns. His beliefs should mostly fall into Christian mysticism.

The fact that you are afraid to write this book is a good thing. It means you are in a strange land. The best work comes from exploration of the unknown. You know this from past experience. Do not fear being afraid. Fear not being afraid.

Pack of boys get off school bus and walk up dirt road. One of the boys is apart from the others. A dog appears on the road. They pressure him to place a clip on the dog’s tail. “Hey boy. Hey I said.” “Hey.” “Why you scared?” “I ain’t.” “Prove it then, chicken shit.” Get sticks and scare it as it runs around in circles. The pastor who lives nearby is feeding his chickens and stops them. Asks the boy his name. Joseph. “All of you, Jesse, Micah, Ryan. Got time to waste messing with this poor animal you got time to help get ready for Cornucopia. Tell your folks you need to be at my place tomorrow eight am sharp. Gonna stop by on my way back so you be sure to tell them. We clear?”

“Clear.”

“What’s your name, son?”

“Joseph.”

“Where you live at?”

“Up on the hill. Past the trailers.”

“That old farmhouse? Thought that place was abandoned. You sure you live there?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Well, let’s walk. I want to speak to your daddy.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You lead the way.”


Action and Dialogue. Action and Dialogue. That is where the story shines. Avoid narration, exposition. Avoid creating a space where *you* can express *your* ideas. If you need internal thoughts, temporarily allow the character to take control of the narrative.

Write about places and people and situations that speak to you. Don't be bored with it or else the reader will also be bored.

Take care to explore various locations, lead the reader through a world they don't yet know. Avoid repetition.


A large hole in the roof, from a dead fallen tree. Grandpa has been trying to repair, but so far unsuccessful. Jacob suggests putting a tarp over it. Grandpa will not hear it.

Action and Dialogue, some description. Avoid narration and exposition! You haven’t been doing that and the story is sucking because of it. As punishment you are going to sit down this weekend and revise the first week’s work. Don’t be disheartened. There are moments of good. Your writing should be solid. True.

What happens now? 12-3-2014

Jacob censures the boys. He expresses something from the heart, that all life is our brothers. You are the caretaker of every thing you meet. We did not make ourselves. We were made by Him that abideth in Eternity. Silence. A kinship that is deeper than blood, deeper than species. What does the silence tell us? Distraction. I don’t talk plainly, I know.

“I understand you.”

“I see by your eyes that you do.”

Wants to speak with Joseph’s father. Tells the other boys to get home, he’ll visit them afterwards.

Punishment work off


What happens now? 12-4-2014

Beth shows Jacob the farm house, outside, the oak tree that has fallen through the roof. Tells him the history of the farm, Ken being sick, Will leaving for work in North Dakota. Joseph watches from the windows. Single. Jacob expresses concern how the place is warmed. The car.

Purpose of this scene is to show their poverty, desperate living conditions. That Joseph is fatherless.

Will left last year. Had to move in with grandpa when he got sick. Water on the brain (Hydrocephalus). No money. Just a pager number. Beth works at Piggly Wiggly.

THE FIRE THAT JACOB SETS BURNS OUT BEFORE BURNING DOWN THE CHURCH


What happens now? 12-6-2014

Joseph and Jacob feed the chickens. “I like to feed them myself. It does my heart good to serve them. Even them.”

“Do you understand me? I know I don’t speak like other people. I tend to get up on a soapbox.”

Is tasked to tear up the garden. The other boys work at the church, carrying hay bales, doing harder work.

They resent him for it. On the break they make fun of him, call him a bastard. Say Pastor Jacob told them you don’t have a daddy no more.

“When will you learn? When? I am ashamed.”
