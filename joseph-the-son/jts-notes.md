Joseph finds his grandfather at rest next to a log. Sits on his lap. They stare at the water for a long time. His grandfather presses his cheek against his own. Body odor and stale beer, sweat.

"What do you feel?"

“Whiskers."

"No. What do you feel?"

"Love."

"He ain't coming back, Joseph. I need you to understand that."
"He is."

"Said your daddy was a sorry son of a bitch. Left yall. Now you gotta live behind that abandoned trailer park, in a shack like hillbillies."
"Fuck you, you motherfucker! I'll kick your fuckin ass!"

A new knife.
"What did I ask you to do?"
"Tell no one."

"If you talk about it, it goes away."
"What does?"

"Why did he leave us?"
"I don't know, Joseph. I wish I did."

Grandfather in the early stages of dementia, cold house, wakes up early and fires up furnace.

A feeling of nature


What is the narrative pull?

  The visitor, the scene with the dog has already happened.
  Jacob, Minister retells the story.
  Invites them to the Fall Festival.
  "You're not like them other boys," he spoke, "Your heart is good."
  "I understand you."
  "Yes. I see by your eyes that you do."

Joseph sat on the porch and gazed down the dirt road. A man appeared from behind a row of pines that canopied the dirt road. They all came that way, car parked at the edge where it was still paved, where the mailboxes were. There was idle talk of pitching in and graveling it or maybe even getting the county to pave it one of these days. But that was just talk. There was no money for such things. Not anymore.

"Well, I'll be."

There coming up the road, the shadow of a man, familiar to him.

Punished after learning about how they tortured the dog, along with some other boys from the neighborhood.
Has to go work for Minister Jacob each afternoon with the others. Arrives at work to find the minister's chickens have been killed.
"Well, shit. Goddamn!" "Sorry, boys. I'm so sorry."
"Might could be that stray dog."

The large story outside the main, not well understood by Joseph. A corruption in the church, an affair, a murder, skipping town with the money raised to rebuild their house. A fire.

At the funeral:
There ain't no more money, darlin. We did what we could, you know, but circumstances change. You understand. Times are hard for everybody. You ain't the only ones. In this economy. You'll be fine. And you're always welcome at the congregation. Jacob was a charismatic man. But he turned out rotten. They found him in a hotel in Alabama, shot himself. Good lord.

What's going to happen to us?
I don't know, baby.
Goddamn this world.

A promise, many promises built on other promises.

Joseph picks up his grandfather's morning chores, following the funeral, lighting the furnace.


The father returns home at the end of the book, in the morning, lights the furnace, sits on the porch and looks towards the road, mirroring when Joseph cleaned the room for his brother.

Grandfather confuses Joseph for Will, his son. Tells him to return.


Like most mornings Joseph sat alone on the porch, feet dangling from a rocking chair that no longer worked because one of the rockers broke off, the wood dry and old, brittle. Grandpa determined to fix it one day, "By God", with an old tire tread cut into a crescent and some baling wire, and it still didn't rock. But at least you could sit in it. And grandpa was proud of his ingenuity and tried to work it into conversations not remotely about rocking chairs.

He liked to sit out there because you could see a long way, clear to the mountain ridge somedays, blue and shadowy in the distance.



Outline
===============

JOSEPH THE SON

Grandfather wakes before everyone else, lights the stove to warm the house, makes coffee in percolator, biscuits with karo syrup, bacon. Watches the sun come up through the window. Intro to knife. Grandpa calls Joseph Will. Joseph and his sister off to school. Mother sleeps in, night shift.

Walking home with boys from school. The dog. Minister Jacob. Chickens.

A visit by Minister Jacob. Joseph gazes lovingly through the outside window at his family indoors, where it was warm. Decorating a small pine with popcorn. A longing deep within. Something so far away from him. Tears came to his eyes. He somehow knew it would always be so. That it was not something he could possess. And it filled his heart with sadness. At least that was how his mind understood it. Invited to Fall Festival Sermon.

That he would lose it over and over again. Florene. If I only understood what it meant to lose my love to eternity. I lost her. Every moment I didn’t want to be in her presence. I remember a summer night I left the house and went for a walk and I cursed her. And now what I wouldn’t give. It doesn’t matter. Nothing else matters. Nothing! That’s what they don’t tell you about life. That all the rest is horseshit. Your job, money, house, car. Horseshit. They don’t tell you that and then by the time you finally understand its too late. Love. More real than those things. I can’t say what I mean. I won’t never again be that boy who got up courage to ask her to go with me to the Shannon barn dance and took her outside and kissed her under the stars that night. She was my love. Mine. 

And there ain’t no Heaven. No after life. No reunification will bring that love back to me again. Don’t bullshit me.

“All of creation is our brothers and sisters, but more than that even. The fingers and toes and arms and legs and torso of one heavenly body. Did you know Saint Assisi called the sun his brother? That is the truth. We must have compassion for them. We must forbear when they do wrong. Mutual reverence for the life, God given.”

“I understand you.” Joseph said.

Jacob paused, glanced to the other boys, disinterested and impatient, and then back to Joseph. 

“Yes,” he placed a gentle hand on his shoulder. “I see by your eyes that you do.”

Work Day One: At work on Jacob’s farm.
	Jesse calls his father ‘left yall. just a no account asshole. and you and your brother are just a bunch of bastards.’
	Joseph lashes out but gets his ass kicked
	Work is tearing down trees to build a garden.

The family goes to Cornucopia. Fundraiser.
	Sermon
	Country Feast (Rich cinnamon apple pies)
	Jacob is inspired to restore the old house they live in

Work Day Two: The dead chickens are discovered. Jacob asks Joseph in secret to discover the culprit, with his brother. Joseph asks Jacob to dinner, on behalf of mother. “No work ethic, them boys. When you old like me you understand the value of work. Doing your part.” 

Look, you’ve done your part here, I guess. More than them other boys anyway. Find out what killed my chickens this morning. I’ll pay you well if you find out what killed them for me. Even more if you catch that sucker.” 

Joseph figured it was probably that old dog from the other day, but he didn’t say a word, and neither did Jacob. They just looked at one another with an understanding that made him uneasy.

“Sure, I can do that.”

“Get your sister to help you, even.”

“Yeah.”

Minister Jacob comes over for dinner. Argument with grandpa. There is no God. Drunk.

Jacob at Dinner table: The heart deceives. A common belief. Yet I am not so sure. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. So, you see. The capacity to judge right and wrong is inside every person. If this were not so then there would be no golden rule.

Lizzie to Jacob, “You’re bald.”
“That’s why I wear this hat. You like it?”

Grandfather whips Noah and Joseph cleans the room, and waits patiently for the sun to rise.

Joseph and his brother look for clues on Jacob’s farm. Joseph receives a new knife, told not to tell anyone. Maybe this will help you on your quest.

Grandfather takes Joseph and Noah out to feed the horses apples, fence breaks. We can fix it tomorrow.

Grandfather gives Joseph the old knife he wanted. “Come back to your family, Will. They need you now. That precious boy needs you.” Joseph cries. “I’m Joseph.” “I know that.”

That’s his way of apologizing. “Your daddy ain’t coming back, Joseph.” “He is.”

Buries the new one he received from Minister Jacob in shame. In the ground, in the dirt where it would stay forever.

Joseph and Noah trace the tracks to an old barn. Jason and other boys have already found the culprit, the old dog. Joseph defends it by repeating what Jacob told them all about God’s grace. They tell him Jacob paid them to hang it for killing the chickens. Joseph is struck by Jesse but does not retaliate. His strength in non-retaliation earns their respect. Sister cries. They keep the dog.

Mother is crying. They somehow overhear the Minister has killed the junior pastor at the behest of the secretary who he was having an affair with. On the run with money they had raised to fix Joseph family’s roof. $8000 total.

Joseph tends to his dog in a makeshift dog house. “You are mine forever.” The dog runs off, past the field, into the woods. Joseph follows him. Ends up at a lake. His grandfather is there. He sits on his lap. “Minister Jacob ran off with the money. He killed a man.” “It doesn’t matter.” “What do you feel?” “Whiskers.” “No. What do you feel?” “Love.”

“Joseph, your grandfather has passed away.”

Funeral. The first snow is falling. Buried next to his love. They learn Jacob shot himself in a Motel 6 outside Birmingham. Left a note that said, “Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do.”

Consoles his mother. “Who was that evil man, Jacob? I invited him into our home. I can’t do this alone. I can’t do it. I give up.” “You’re not alone.” Stokes the fire and it burns until the small hours of the morning.

In the early morning hours, Will enters the house, using an old key. He brings in wood for the stove and kindles it. Make a pot of coffee, and waits for the sun to rise.


Main Characters
===================

Joseph - Awaits the return of his father, unspoken and yet understood by all. Minister Jacob becomes father figure.

Lizzie - About five. Assumes the feelings and ideas of those around her. Joseph is protective, but annoyed by her.

Mother (Beth) - Trying to hold things together, starts a new life, falls in love with the promises that Minister Jacob makes. I give up. I don’t know what to do anymore. God damn. God damn this world.

Grandfather (Kenneth) - Living in a state of dementia. Wants to rebuild the house as it has fallen into disrepair. No belief in God, but reveals the mystery to Joseph. Beth calls him “Mr. Kenneth”.

Father (Will) - The returner.

Minister Jacob

Each of the main characters needs their own story arc, with its own rises and falls. In this book, the plot should be light and unimposing, creeping in around scenes that are more about the characters. Moments, moods, memories. Suggested rather than told.

The words that Jesus said are not true because he spoke them. Truth is not truth because who speaks the words. Lies are not lies because they come from the mouth of a liar.

The lie is not the lie because it proceeds from the mouth of a liar. The truth is not the truth because it proceeds from the mouth of a truth-teller.

Minister Jacob tells the story of the house he never built.

Important that scenes lead into one another organically, and do not seem episodic. This leads to blurred line between reality and dream later.

Minister Jacob’s hypocrisy reveals itself through the ‘fruit’ of his actions, never from his demeanor or words.

Establish early that Joseph wants the rusty old knife that sits on the shelf. Grandfather polishes it up the best he can and gives it for his birthday.

Worried about the winter. No heat. Ostracized from the church after the incident. Mother somehow implicated.

"It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what is."

Grandpa Ken: Loss
Minister Jacob: Hope

Minister Jacob offers to drive Beth to work. Uses that as a way to smuggle goods out of the church to his house.

No one at funeral. Behind the house. Hires Jesse and gang to dig. Woman comes to pay her respects, update on Jacob (suicide) and for their family not to come around for awhile.

What makes this story compelling? We follow the events through the eyes of a boy who is having to become more responsible, what he is interested in, the dog, the chickens, the knife, the bullies, his sister, snow, fall, cinnamon apples with milk, and yet in the background there is a story unfolding, Minister Jacob’s corruption of the church, Grandpa’s struggles to repair the house for Winter, Minister Jacob wooing the mother. Plot points should reveal themselves by suggestion and indirection, in the background sometimes.

Even though it deals with a minister and the church, do not get into specific Christian ideas. Keep it universal, metaphysical if you go there. It almost should not matter what religion it is.

The story seems to want to take place in an indistinct time. Don’t force the point. Have cars. Have TV. Avoid any more technology than that.

This story is a challenge because unlike your other stories, this one doesn’t have anything *big* going on in the main plotline, except for grandfather’s natural death and the murder of the youth minister, which stays background action. The trick is to make it *feel* big.

Mother cries after the funeral and Joseph consoles her. They fall asleep in Joseph’s bed.

Not in school because of ‘fall break’, an indeterminate time away from school.

Creating wealth in this world. House on a hill. Look at what it has now become. This tomb of a home. Do you think I was always wrinkled and ugly like I am now?  Do you think my mind was always slow? I was once like you. Smooth skin like Lizzie there, sharp in mind. I had money that I spent on myself and others. I was humbled to be able to give to the poor. I lorded it over those who had none while pretending to be humble.


There is a hole in the main living area. Grandpa is working on a repair. Makes more holes.

Jacob wants the boys to tear up a garden.

Will has gotten a message from Beth about his father is why he returns.


First sentence should describe dog being tortured.

The story opens on the walk home from school. They are coming home earlier in the day because of Fall break. Joseph is with a group of boys who live in the trailer park next to his house. They stop to torture a stray dog. Joseph is not reluctant to join in, even though he is not really *friends* with them. Minister Jacob is outside tending to his chickens and sees them. He steps in and censures the boys. He recognizes Joseph as someone new to the neighborhood and asks if he is from the family that just moved into the old house on the hill. When he finds out he is, he wants to speak with the Joseph’s father. Tells the other boys to get on home.


Joseph takes up Minister Jacob’s censure literally, becomes vegetarian. At the dinner Minister Jacob is eating meat. They discuss.

What passage is that?

Not from the scripture. What is a true thing?

Integration and Disintegration. Is all there is.

How do we know what is true?

Mother’s car has broken alternator. Minister Jacob takes to his house to fix. That is the car they escape in.

Grandpa is upset that Jacob is helping him. Think you’re God Almighty? How arrogant. I hate this. The conversation about vegetarianism brings in Grandpa. “It doesn’t matter what you believe. It doesn’t matter what I believe. It only matters what *is*.”

I can’t.
Why?
It’s wrong.
God placed us in this world, Joseph. It is not a sin to feed your family. We revere the animal for the life it has given up. Life must feed on life to live.
Why do you consider this chicken to be a life, and yet not a piece of fruit? It has a life.
Do you understand?
I do.
It is not for us to know God’s will.
I won’t have you come into my home and feed my family this horseshit. Lies.
They are not lies, sir.
Confusion then. Look at what you’ve done to my grandson. He can’t even eat his dinner.

If it is okay to kill animals for food then why was just messing around with an animal so bad? I don’t get it.

Jesse and Joseph get into a fight because Jesse calls him a bastard. Minister Jacob breaks it up - “He is your brother, why do you strike your brother, Joseph.”

Lizzie has a cold, perhaps pneumonia. She won’t eat.


Nimrod killed animals: Genesis 10:9

Why Is Cruelty Wrong? by Teri Rivas
God allows us to benefit from the animals. Bible principles allow us to kill animals to provide food and clothing or to protect ourselves from harm. (Genesis 3:21; 9:3; Exodus 21:28) However, life is sacred to God. Our dominion over the animals must be exercised in a balanced way that shows respect for life. The Bible speaks negatively of a man named Nimrod, who apparently killed animals and perhaps humans for the sheer thrill of it.—Genesis 10:9.
Jesus spoke of God’s concern for animals in these words: "Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not? Yet not one of them goes forgotten before God." (Luke 12:6) Also, when changing his mind about destroying a city full of practicers of wickedness who had repented, God himself said: "Ought I not to feel sorry for Nineveh the great city, in which there exist more than one hundred and twenty thousand men . . . , besides many domestic animals?" (Jonah 4:11) Obviously, he does not regard animals as just disposable items, to be thrown away at will.
When giving the Israelites laws, God taught them proper care of animals. He required them to return a stray animal to its owner and to help animals in distress. (Exodus 23:4, 5) Animals were to benefit from a Sabbath rest, just like humans. (Exodus 23:12) There were laws governing the proper treatment of farm animals. (Deuteronomy 22:10; 25:4) Obviously, animals were to be cared for and guarded, not exploited.
Proverbs 12:10 explicitly states God’s viewpoint: "The righteous one is caring for the soul of his domestic animal, but the mercies of the wicked ones are cruel." A Bible commentary renders this verse as follows: "A righteous man’s kindness extends even to dumb animals, but a wicked man is cruel, even when he thinks he is being most gentle."—Believer’s Bible Commentary, by William MacDonald.
The righteous man treats animals with kindness and seeks to know their needs. A wicked person may vocally express love for animals, but his "mercies," at best, are actually cruel. His actions betray the selfish motive he has in mind. How true this is of those who pit one animal against another in hopes of winning money!
Relief for the Animals
True, God’s original purpose was that man have "in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth." (Genesis 1:28) Cruelty to animals has no place in that purpose. The inhuman treatment of animals will not go on forever. We have reason to believe that God will stop all unnecessary suffering. But how?
He promises to do away with wicked and cruel people. (Proverbs 2:22) Regarding the animals, Hosea 2:18 says: "I shall certainly conclude a covenant in that day in connection with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground." How wonderful it will be to live during that time, when peaceful conditions will benefit not only upright humans but also the animals!
KINDNESS TO ANIMALS
Animals were also given kind consideration. If a man saw a domestic animal in distress he was required to help it, even if it belonged to an enemy of his. (Exodus 23:4, 5; Deuteronomy 22:4) Beasts of burden were not to be overworked or mistreated. (Deuteronomy 22:10; Proverbs 12:10) The bull was not to be muzzled so that he could not enjoy the fruits of his labor when threshing grain. (Deuteronomy 25:4) Kindness to wild animals was also fostered. A man was not to remove both a mother bird and her eggs, thereby wiping out the family. (Deuteronomy 22:6, 7) Among domestic animals an individual was not to slaughter a bull or a sheep and its young on the same day. All of this was a deterrent to a spirit of cruelty.—Leviticus 22:28; compare God’s consideration for animals as expressed at Jonah 4:11 and Leviticus 25:4, 5, 7.
Additional Thoughts
"The righteous one is caring for the soul of his domestic animal, but the mercies of the wicked ones are cruel" -Proverbs 12:10
God created us with this desire to relate to animals. When he made man he said to him, at Genesis 1:28: ‘Your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control. I am putting you in charge of the fish, the birds, and all the wild animals.’ Man is now failing miserably to meet this charge. Instead, he has polluted the earth and destroyed many animal species and endangered many more.
"But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give [their] reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth." -Revelation 11:18
How delightful it will be when Jehovah acts to eliminate, earth wide, the abuse of animals and also of people who suffer under this present system of things! Many persons will then enjoy the paradise earth that Jehovah has purposed for appreciative humankind, for those who will carry out his charge to care for its plants and animals and who will love their neighbors as themselves.

Isaiah 11:6-9 "And the wolf will actually reside for a while with the male lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the calf and the maned young lion and the well-fed animal all together; and a mere little boy will be leader over them. 7 And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their young ones will lie down. And even the lion will eat straw just like the bull. 8 And the sucking child will certainly play upon the hole of the cobra; and upon the light aperture of a poisonous snake will a weaned child actually put his own hand. 9 They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea"
Isaiah 65:25 "'The wolf and the lamb themselves will feed as one, and the lion will eat straw just like the bull; and as for the serpent, his food will be dust. They will do no harm nor cause any ruin in all my holy mountain,' Jehovah has said"
Psalm 37:11 "But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace"
Psalm 37:28, 29 "To time indefinite they will certainly be guarded; But as for the offspring of the wicked ones, they will indeed be cut off. The righteous themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it"
Can the abused earth, its animals and its peoples, use that promised paradise? Can a duck use webbed feet?
Therefore, continue to pray as directed by Jesus in Matthew 6:9,10 "YOU must pray, then, this way:Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. 10 Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. 11 Give us today our bread for this day; 12 and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 13 And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one."
I read an article, "Help for Animals Abused by Man" RE: Wildlife Waystation a 160-acre animal compound north of Los Angeles, up Little Tujunga canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains.
