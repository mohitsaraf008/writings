A story about how the mystery reveals itself (Death of Grandfather)
A story about a love of the natural world (Old Farm in Georgia)

A story about nostalgia and a longing for a time that won't return (Childhood)
A story about a boy who's deepest wish is for his estranged father to return home (He does!)

Modern technology: cars, bars, television (and yet indistinct, no computers)

The feeling of a mild summer twilight, the time of lighting bugs, the smell of grass and flowers.

Joseph finds his grandfather at rest next to a log. Sits on his lap. They stare at the water for a long time. His grandfather presses his cheek against his own. Body odor and stale beer, sweat.

"What do you feel?"

"I feel whiskers."

"No, what do you feel?"

"Love."



"He ain't coming back, Joseph. I need you to understand that."
"He is."

"Said your daddy was a sorry son of a bitch. Left yall. Now you gotta live behind that abandoned trailer park, in a shack like hillbillies."
"Fuck you, you motherfucker! I'll kick your fuckin ass!"

A new knife.
"What did I ask you to do?"
"Tell no one."

"If you talk about it, it goes away."
"What does?"

"Why did he leave us?"
"I don't know, Joseph. I wish I did."

Grandfather in the early stages of dementia, cold house, wakes up early and fires up furnace.

A feeling of nature


What is the narrative pull?

  The visitor, the scene with the dog has already happened.
  Jacob, Minister retells the story.
  Invites them to the 4th Party.
  "You're not like them other boys," he spoke, "Your heart is good."
  "I understand you."
  "Yes. I see by your eyes that you do."

Joseph sat on the porch and gazed down the dirt road. A man appeared from behind a row of pines that canopied the dirt road. They all came that way, car parked at the edge where it was still paved, where the mailboxes were. There was idle talk of pitching in and graveling it or maybe even getting the county to pave it one of these days. But that was just talk.

"Well, I'll be."

There coming up the road, the shadow of a man, familiar to him.

Punished after learning about how they tortured the dog, along with some other boys from the neighborhood.
Has to go work for Minister Jacob each afternoon with the others. Arrives at work to find the minister's chickens have been killed.
"Well, shit. Goddamn!" "Sorry, boys. I'm so sorry."
"Might could be that stray dog."

The large story outside the main, not well understood by Joseph. A corruption in the church, an affair, a murder, skipping town with the money raised to rebuild their house. A fire.

At the funeral:
There ain't no more money, darlin. We did what we could at the time, you know. You understand. Times are hard for everybody these days. In this economy and all. You'll be fine. And you're always welcome at the congregation. Jacob was a charismatic man. But he turned out rotten. They found him in a hotel in Alabama, shot himself. Good lord.

What's going to happen to us?
I don't know, baby.
Goddamn this world. Goddamn it all to hell.

A promise, many promises built on other promises.

Joseph picks up his grandfather's morning chores, following the funeral, lighting the furnace.
