Joseph finds his grandfather at rest next to a log. Sits on his lap. They stare at the water for a long time. His grandfather presses his cheek against his own. Body odor and stale beer, sweat.

"What do you feel?"

"I feel whiskers."

"No, what do you feel?"

"Love."

"He ain't coming back, Joseph. I need you to understand that."
"He is."

"Said your daddy was a sorry son of a bitch. Left yall. Now you gotta live behind that abandoned trailer park, in a shack like hillbillies."
"Fuck you, you motherfucker! I'll kick your fuckin ass!"

A new knife.
"What did I ask you to do?"
"Tell no one."

"If you talk about it, it goes away."
"What does?"

"Why did he leave us?"
"I don't know, Joseph. I wish I did."

Grandfather in the early stages of dementia, cold house, wakes up early and fires up furnace.

A feeling of nature


What is the narrative pull?

  The visitor, the scene with the dog has already happened.
  Jacob, Minister retells the story.
  Invites them to the Fall Festival.
  "You're not like them other boys," he spoke, "Your heart is good."
  "I understand you."
  "Yes. I see by your eyes that you do."

Joseph sat on the porch and gazed down the dirt road. A man appeared from behind a row of pines that canopied the dirt road. They all came that way, car parked at the edge where it was still paved, where the mailboxes were. There was idle talk of pitching in and graveling it or maybe even getting the county to pave it one of these days. But that was just talk. There was no money for such things. Not anymore.

"Well, I'll be."

There coming up the road, the shadow of a man, familiar to him.

Punished after learning about how they tortured the dog, along with some other boys from the neighborhood.
Has to go work for Minister Jacob each afternoon with the others. Arrives at work to find the minister's chickens have been killed.
"Well, shit. Goddamn!" "Sorry, boys. I'm so sorry."
"Might could be that stray dog."

The large story outside the main, not well understood by Joseph. A corruption in the church, an affair, a murder, skipping town with the money raised to rebuild their house. A fire.

At the funeral:
There ain't no more money, darlin. We did what we could, you know, but circumstances change. You understand. Times are hard for everybody. You ain't the only ones. In this economy. You'll be fine. And you're always welcome at the congregation. Jacob was a charismatic man. But he turned out rotten. They found him in a hotel in Alabama, shot himself. Good lord.

What's going to happen to us?
I don't know, baby.
Goddamn this world.

A promise, many promises built on other promises.

Joseph picks up his grandfather's morning chores, following the funeral, lighting the furnace.


The father returns home at the end of the book, in the morning, lights the furnace, sits on the porch and looks towards the road, mirroring when Joseph cleaned the room for his brother.

Grandfather confuses Joseph for Will, his son. Tells him to return.


Like most mornings Joseph sat alone on the porch, feet dangling from a rocking chair that no longer worked because one of the rockers broke off, the wood dry and old, brittle. Grandpa determined to fix it one day, "By God", with an old tire tread cut into a crescent and some baling wire, and it still didn't rock. But at least you could sit in it. And grandpa was proud of his ingenuity and tried to work it into conversations not remotely about rocking chairs.

He liked to sit out there because you could see a long way, clear to the mountain ridge somedays, blue and shadowy in the distance.



Outline
===============

Joseph and Grandfather repair the fence one afternoon in the snow, packed down. Deep in winter.

JOSEPH THE SON

Grandfather wakes before everyone else, lights the stove to warm the house, makes coffee, biscuits. Watches the sun come up through the window.

A visit by Minister Jacob. Joseph gazes lovingly through the outside window at his family indoors, where it was warm. Decorating a small pine with popcorn. A longing deep within. Something so far away from him. Tears came to his eyes. He somehow knew it would always be so. That it was not something he could possess. And it filled his heart with sadness. At least that was how his mind understood it. Invited to Fall Festival Sermon

“All of creation is our brothers and sisters.”

Work Day One: At work on Jacob’s farm.
	Jesse calls his father ‘left yall. just a no account asshole. and you and your brother are just a bunch of bastards.’
	Joseph lashes out but gets his ass kicked
	Work is tearing down trees to build a garden.

The family goes to Cornucopia. Fundraiser.
	Sermon
	Country Feast (Rich cinnamon apple pies)
	Jacob is inspired to restore the old house they live in

Work Day Two: The dead chickens are discovered. Jacob asks Joseph in secret to discover the culprit, with his brother. Joseph asks Jacob to dinner, on behalf of mother.

Minister Jacob comes over for dinner. Argument with grandpa. There is no God. Drunk.

Jacob at Dinner table: The heart deceives. A common belief. Yet I am not so sure. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. So, you see. The capacity to judge right and wrong is inside every person. If this were not so then there would be no golden rule.

You look like Jesus. Except you’re bald.
That’s why I wear this hat. You like it?

Grandfather whips Noah and Joseph cleans the room, and waits patiently for the sun to rise.

Joseph and his brother look for clues on Jacob’s farm. Joseph receives a new knife, told not to tell anyone.

Grandfather takes Joseph and Noah out to feed the horses apples, fence breaks. We can fix it tomorrow.

For his birthday, grandfather gives Joseph the old knife he wanted. “Come back to your family, Will. They need you now. That precious boy Joseph needs you.” Joseph cries.

That’s his way of apologizing. “Your daddy ain’t coming back, Joseph.” “He is.”

Buries the new one he received from Minister Jacob in shame. Where it would stay forever.

Joseph and Noah trace the tracks to an old barn. Jason and other boys have already found the culprit, the old dog. Joseph defends it by repeating what Jacob told them all about God’s grace. They tell him Jacob paid them to hang it for killing the chickens. Joseph is struck by Jesse but does not retaliate. Brother cries. They keep the dog.

Mother is crying. They somehow overhear the Minister has killed the junior pastor at the behest of the secretary who he was having an affair with. On the run with money they had raised to fix Joseph family’s roof. $8000 total.

Joseph tends to his dog in a makeshift dog house. “You are mine forever.” The dog runs off, past the field, into the woods. Joseph follows him. Ends up at a lake. His grandfather is there. He sits on his lap. “Minister Jacob ran off with the money. He killed a man.” “It doesn’t matter.” “What do you feel?” “Whiskers.” “No. What do you feel?” “Love.”

“Joseph, your grandfather has passed away.”

Funeral. The first snow is falling. Buried next to his love. They learn Jacob shot himself in a Motel 6 outside Birmingham. Left a note that said, “Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do.”

In the early morning hours, Will enters the house, using an old key. He brings in wood for the stove and kindles it. Make a pot of coffee, and waits for the sun to rise.


Main Characters
===================

Joseph - Awaits the return of his father, unspoken and yet understood by all. Minister Jacob becomes father figure.

Lizzie - About five. Assumes the feelings and ideas of those around her. Joseph is protective, but annoyed by her.

Mother (Beth) - Trying to hold things together, starts a new life, falls in love with the promises that Minister Jacob makes. I give up. I don’t know what to do anymore. God damn. God damn this world.

Grandfather (Kenneth) - Living in a state of dementia. Wants to rebuild the house as it has fallen into disrepair. No belief in God, but reveals the mystery to Joseph. Beth calls him “Mr. Kenneth”.

Father (Will) - The returner.

Minister Jacob

Each of the main characters needs their own story arc, with its own rises and falls. In this book, the plot should be light and unimposing, creeping in around scenes that are more about the characters. Moments, moods, memories. Suggested rather than told.

The words that Jesus said are not true because he spoke them. Truth is not truth because who speaks the words. Lies are not lies because they come from the mouth of a liar.

The lie is not the lie because it proceeds from the mouth of a liar. The truth is not the truth because it proceeds from the mouth of a truth-teller.

Minister Jacob tells the story of the house he never built.

Important that scenes lead into one another organically, and do not seem episodic. This leads to blurred line between reality and dream later.

Minister Jacob’s hypocrisy reveals itself through the ‘fruit’ of his actions, never from his demeanor or words.

Establish early that Joseph wants the rusty old knife that sits on the shelf. Grandfather polishes it up the best he can and gives it for his birthday.

Worried about the winter. No heat. Ostracized from the church after the incident. Mother somehow implicated.

"It doesn't matter what you believe. It doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what *is*."

Grandpa Ken: Loss
Minister Jacob: Hope

Minister Jacob offers to drive Beth to work. Uses that as a way to smuggle goods out of the church to his house.

No one at funeral. Behind the house. Hires Jesse and gang to dig. Woman comes to pay her respects, update on Jacob (suicide) and for their family not to come around for awhile.

What makes this story compelling? We follow the events through the eyes of a boy who is having to become more responsible, what he is interested in, the dog, the chickens, the knife, the bullies, his sister, snow, fall, cinnamon apples with milk, and yet in the background there is a story unfolding, Minister Jacob’s corruption of the church, Grandpa’s struggles to repair the house for Winter, Minister Jacob wooing the mother. Plot points should reveal themselves by suggestion and indirection, in the background sometimes.

Even though it deals with a minister and the church, do not get into specific Christian ideas. Keep it universal, metaphysical if you go there. It almost should not matter what religion it is.

The story seems to want to take place in an indistinct time. Don’t force the point. Have cars. Have TV. Avoid any more technology than that.

This story is a challenge because unlike your other stories, this one doesn’t have anything *big* going on in the main plotline, except for grandfather’s natural death and the murder of the youth minister, which stays background action. The trick is to make it *feel* big.

Mother cries after the funeral and Joseph consoles her. They fall asleep in Joseph’s bed.

Not in school because of ‘fall break’, an indeterminate time away from school.
