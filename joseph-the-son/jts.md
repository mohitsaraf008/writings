JOSEPH THE SON by Daniel Stepp

Joseph was used to the darkness by now, finding his way in the darkness, without the use of his eyes. In the night a snow had come and blanketed the field behind the old barn. Morning now and yet still dark. The family asleep in the house. The hogs asleep in the barn. They two were the only ones awake. The boy followed behind his grandfather and tried to match the footprints his boots left in the powder. Joseph in his winter coat, a scrap of shirt wrapped around his mouth and nose. He breathed through the material and felt his hot breath mingle with the crisp air. He carried a hammer and some pegs and soon saw the edge of the woods and the broken fence. They stopped.



...and gazed long and deep past the fallen limbs and brambles at the edge of the woods, where he was not allowed to go.
