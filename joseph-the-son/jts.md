It was still dark when grandpa Ken came to wake him. 

“Be sure and put on your long johns,” he whispered, “and try not to wake up Lizzie, hear?”

At that he left the room.

Joseph rolled from under the warmth of his sleeping bag onto the cold wood. Wobbling in place for nearly a minute he finally became conscious enough to feel how cold it was in the room. He kicked his legs in place and rubbed his bare arms together to get some circulation going. Once his eyes had become adjusted to what little light there was he crept over to the chest of drawers. He pulled open the middle drawer but it creaked despite his most cautious movement. He winced and went utterly still, but his sister didn’t stir. After a moment he slid on his long johns and then a few more layers of pants, shirts, a sweater. He grabbed his survival knife from its place on the nightstand and joined his grandfather in the main room.

Heat from the stove in the kitchen enveloped him as he came up behind his grandfather at the table and stood there, not fully awake.

“Hold out your arms,” Grandpa said. He noticed Joseph nodding in place, his eyes nearly shut, so he gave one his cheeks a good pinch. His eyes opened wide.

“Hold out your arms.”

In them he placed a newly-sharpened ax, some length of twine, and a rolled up tarp. Joseph could barely carry it all, but shuffled them around until he had a good hold. Grandpa watched him with some amusement.

“Got your knife on you?”

“Yes sir.”

“Good boy. Want a biscuit?”

He did.

Grandpa buttered one of the drop biscuits Beth had made the day before, hardened now, but still edible. As Joseph could not carry the biscuit his grandfather placed it in his mouth.

“Ready?”

Joseph mumbled.

“Let’s do it then.”

Out the front door they went but turned left from the porch and  headed towards the shed. There was no moonlight this time of morning and sunlight was just a sliver behind the line of trees on the hills in the distance. But even that was enough to illuminate the snow on the ground and light their way.

Their footsteps crunching through snow and ice was the only sound to be heard this early morning. Their slow but steady march the only movement. Everything else was silent and still on the hill where they lived.

Joseph breathed through an old t-shirt he used to cover his mouth and neck area. He smelled the old sweat warmed by his breath but it was not unpleasant as it reminded him of summer days. His exhalation made a visible puff of air each time, and he noticed his grandfather’s breath do the same.

They walked past the shed to the edge of the woods. It was darker in the woods, but grandfather didn’t miss a step as he stomped a few briars to make a path through for them.

By this point Joseph was not paying much attention to where they were, only following the back of his grandfather’s coat, which he could barely make out, the rough wool material came nearly to his knees. So when his grandfather switched on the flashlight and lit up a ten foot area in front of them, it startled him at first.

The winter woods lit by the flashlight appeared to him to be some alien landscape. Bizarre and menacing. A haze floated through the air, snow or dust they had kicked up. The space between the maples and pines was enough to easily walk through, except for the briars. Luckily grandpa carried a machete and wore his boots.

Another five minutes of walking and they were deep enough so that when Joseph looked back he could no longer see the lights from the kitchen window. All the time the place was getting brighter but here it was still too dark to see, canopied over by the tall trees.

Joseph knew what they were looking for this far in the woods. His grandfather made rounds every few weeks through the woods with two of spray paint and marked ones he thought would make the best firewood and others for carpentry work. He had a system. Orange for firewood. Blue for carpentry. They had passed several orange-marked trees already, but they had not yet seen a blue one.

At one point grandpa stopped and Joseph, not paying attention, ran straight into him and dropped the ax. Grandpa turned around harshly and picked up the ax, then returned to the woods and scratched his head. He shone his light in all directions and finally it landed on a particular midsize pine among several others. On its trunk was a blue ‘X’. They set to work. 

Joseph unfurled the tarp onto the ground while grandfather started chipping away at one side of the tree with ax in one hand, flashlight in the other. Once the cut path was established, grandfather handed the ax to Joseph, showed him how to hold it properly and where to hit on the tree and at what angle. Then he held the flashlight up while Joseph took his swings. The young boy swung wildly but making enough progress with just shear force.

“Don’t wear yourself out,” Grandpa said, “You’re gonna need the strength later.”

Thirty minutes passed and the morning light shone through the bare branches. They no longer needed the flashlight, dim though the light still was. Both grandpa and Joseph had taken turns and were both well tired. Joseph tried do more but his arm was just about give out. Grandpa pushed him on seeing how close they were, the wedge-shaped angle had just about reached the other side.

And then it cracked. Joseph stood back and his grandfather put his boot on the chopped side and pushed.

“Give it push, Joseph.”

They both pushed the tree hard and finally gave it enough momentum to tear. The tree cracked and fell slow and hard onto the ground, just missing a nearby oak.

After a rest Grandpa picked up the ax and walked a length from the base to about ten foot. At that point he made a notch with the ax and gave a few swings.

“We’ll cut her here, split the log, and then come back later for the rest as firewood. Savvy?”

“Yes sir.”

Joseph took that as his cue to pick up the ax again. For the next hour they took turns chopping through the log, and then once chopped to the right length driving a wedge into a gap and splitting it lengthwise, first into two, then into four.

By now it was morning. A pale light fell over the trees and the ground, covered with snow in places. Joseph looked at his grandfather. He was tired and ready to call it a day. But he knew they still had much to do. His grandfather smiled at him and told him to be tough.

They pulled the split logs onto the tarp and then each grabbed a corner and started the drag out of the woods. It was slow-going but easier than they thought it would be, as heavy as the logs were. They dragged and dragged. Joseph pulled off his cap and the shirt from his neck. He was sweating.

Soon they came to the edge of the woods. Joseph could see his mother in the kitchen from here, now that it was light. She was preparing breakfast. Lizzie was crying for something at her feet. He wanted grandpa to tell them to quit so they could have breakfast and rest. But he couldn’t say so himself. He knew that.

Once they were on the snow the drag was much easier. They pulled it past the shed and over to the fence separating their land from the large field. The broken section was just as it was left, the rotten wood disintegrated into pieces at the post hole.

They pulled the rotten fence rails from the post holes and cleaned it out. The rails fell apart in their hands it was so far gone. “Past time for this,” Grandpa remarked. Joseph nodded in agreement, although really his mind was on eggs and bacon, and fresh biscuits.

The area now clean from all the old rails, they did some last-minute trimming on the new rail ends, just so they would fit into the existing post holes. Then they lifted each end into place, starting at the bottom. Then once that one was in place, it was that much easier to do the next one, resting it on the lower rail.

Once all four rails were in place, grandpa got the roll of twine and told Joseph to get out his knife. Grandpa unspooled about three feet of twine and held it out for Joseph to cut. Joseph flipped open the rusty blade (still sharp) and cut the twine. Then grandpa wrapped it around each post rail join in a figure eight, tucking in the end. He showed Joseph how this was done and they each took another post rail join and finished in less than half an hour.

Once finished, grandpa took a step back and asked Joseph to stand with him. They admired their work. It had taken all morning, nearly five hours. Then they put the old rails onto the tarp and pulled it over to the firepit and unloaded it.

“Bad wood for fence, good wood for fire.”

“Yeah,” Joseph agreed, without really knowing what he was agreeing to, so numb from the work.

Grandpa laughed and put his arm around Joseph and hugged him tight.

The sun was high overhead and it was even warm where they stood. The snow was beginning to melt. It never stayed in these parts. Joseph and his grandfather walked back to the house, where his mother had prepared a large breakfast for them both.
