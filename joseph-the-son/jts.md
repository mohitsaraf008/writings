It was still dark when grandpa came to wake him. 

“Be sure and put on your long johns,” he whispered, “and try not to wake up Lizzie, hear?”

At that he left the room.

Joseph rolled from under the warmth of his sleeping bag onto the cold wood. Wobbling in place for nearly a minute he finally became conscious enough to feel how cold it was in the room. He kicked his legs in place and rubbed his bare arms together to get some circulation going. Once his eyes had become adjusted to what little light there was he crept over to the chest of drawers. He pulled open the middle drawer but it creaked despite his most cautious movement. He winced and went utterly still, but his sister didn’t stir. After a moment he slid on his long johns and then a few more layers of pants, shirts, a sweater. He grabbed his survival knife from its place on the nightstand and joined his grandfather in the main room.

Heat from the stove in the kitchen enveloped him as he came up behind his grandfather at the table and stood there, not fully awake.

“Hold out your arms,” Grandpa said. He noticed Joseph nodding in place, his eyes nearly shut, so he gave one his cheeks a good pinch. His eyes opened wide.

“Hold out your arms.”

In them he placed a newly-sharpened ax, some length of twine, and a rolled up tarp. Joseph could barely carry it all, but shuffled them around until he had a good hold. Grandpa watched him with some amusement.

“Got your knife on you?”

“Yes sir.”

“Biscuit?”

“Yes.”

Grandpa buttered one of the drop biscuits Beth had made the day before, hardened now, but still edible. As Joseph could not carry the biscuit his grandfather placed it in his mouth.

“Ready?”

Joseph mumbled.

“Let’s do it then.”

Out the front door they went but turned left from the porch and  headed towards the shed. There was no moonlight this time of morning and sunlight was just a sliver behind the line of trees on the hills in the distance. But even that was enough to illuminate the snow on the ground and light their way.

Their footsteps crunching through snow and ice was the only sound to be heard this early morning. Their slow but steady march the only movement. Everything else was silent and still on the hill where they lived.

Joseph breathed through an old t-shirt he used to cover his mouth and neck area. He smelled the old sweat warmed by his breath but it was not unpleasant as it reminded him of summer days. His exhalation made a visible puff of air each time, and he noticed his grandfather’s breath do the same.

They walked past the shed to the edge of the woods. It was darker in the woods, but grandfather didn’t miss a step as he stomped a few briars to make a path through for them.

By this point Joseph was not paying much attention to where they were, only following the back of his grandfather’s coat, which he could barely make out, the rough wool material came nearly to his knees. So when his grandfather switched on the flashlight and lit up a ten foot area in front of them, it startled him at first.

The winter woods lit by the flashlight appeared to him to be some alien landscape. Bizarre and menacing. A haze floated through the air, snow or dust they had kicked up. The space between the maples and pines was enough to easily walk through, except for the briars. Luckily grandpa carried a machete and wore his boots.

Another five minutes of walking and they were deep enough so that when Joseph looked back he could no longer see the lights from the kitchen window. All the time the place was getting brighter but here it was still too dark to see, canopied over by the tall trees.

Joseph knew what they were looking for this far in the woods. His grandfather made rounds every few weeks through the woods with two of spray paint and marked ones he thought would make the best firewood and others for carpentry work. He had a system. Orange for firewood. Blue for carpentry. They had passed several orange-marked trees already, but they had not yet seen a blue one.

At one point grandpa stopped and Joseph, not paying attention, ran straight into him and dropped the ax. Grandpa turned around harshly and picked up the ax, then returned to the woods and scratched his head. He shone his light in all directions and finally it landed on a particular midsize pine among several others. On its trunk was a blue ‘X’. They set to work. 

Joseph unfurled the tarp onto the ground while grandfather started chipping away at one side of the tree with ax in one hand, flashlight in the other. Once the cut path was established, grandfather handed the ax to Joseph, showed him how to hold it properly and where to hit on the tree and at what angle. Then he held the flashlight up while Joseph took his swings. The young boy swung wildly but making enough progress with just shear force.

“Don’t wear yourself out,” Grandpa said, “You’re gonna need the strength later.”

Thirty minutes passed and the morning light shone through the bare branches. They no longer needed the flashlight, dim though the light still was. Both grandpa and Joseph had taken turns and were both well tired. Joseph tried do more but his arm was just about give out. Grandpa pushed him on seeing how close they were, the wedge-shaped angle had just about reached the other side.

And then it cracked. Joseph stood back and his grandfather put his boot on the chopped side and pushed.

“Give it a push, Joseph.”

They both pushed the tree hard and finally gave it enough momentum to tear. The tree cracked and fell slow and hard onto the ground, just missing a nearby oak.

After a rest Grandpa picked up the ax and walked a length from the base to about ten foot. At that point he made a notch with the ax and gave a few swings.

“We’ll cut her here, split the log, and then come back later for the rest as firewood. Savvy?”

“Yes sir.”

Joseph took that as his cue to pick up the ax again. For the next hour they took turns chopping through the log, and then once chopped to the right length driving a wedge into a gap and splitting it lengthwise, first into two, then into four.

By now it was morning. A pale light fell over the trees and the ground, covered with snow in places. Joseph looked at his grandfather. He was tired and ready to call it a day. But he knew they still had much to do. His grandfather smiled at him and told him to be tough.

They pulled the split logs onto the tarp and then each grabbed a corner and started the drag out of the woods. It was slow-going but easier than they thought it would be, as heavy as the logs were. They dragged and dragged. Joseph pulled off his cap and the shirt from his neck. He was sweating.

Soon they came to the edge of the woods. Joseph could see his mother in the kitchen from here, now that it was light. She was preparing breakfast. Lizzie was crying for something at her feet. He wanted grandpa to tell them to quit so they could have breakfast and rest. But he couldn’t say so himself. He knew that.

Once they were on the snow the drag was much easier. They pulled it past the shed and over to the fence separating their land from the large field. The broken section was just as it was left, the rotten wood disintegrated into pieces at the post hole.

They pulled the rotten fence rails from the post holes and cleaned it out. The rails fell apart in their hands it was so far gone. “Past time for this,” Grandpa remarked. Joseph nodded in agreement, although really his mind was on eggs and bacon, and fresh biscuits.

The area now clean from all the old rails, they did some last-minute trimming on the new rail ends, just so they would fit into the existing post holes. Then they lifted each end into place, starting at the bottom. Then once that one was in place, it was that much easier to do the next one, resting it on the lower rail.

Once all four rails were in place, grandpa got the roll of twine and told Joseph to get out his knife. Grandpa unspooled about three feet of twine and held it out for Joseph to cut. Joseph flipped open the rusty blade (still sharp) and cut the twine. Then grandpa wrapped it around each post rail join in a figure eight, tucking in the end. He showed Joseph how this was done and they each took another post rail join and finished in less than half an hour.

Once finished, grandpa took a step back and asked Joseph to stand with him. They admired their work. It had taken all morning, nearly five hours. Then they put the old rails onto the tarp and pulled it over to the firepit and unloaded it.

“Bad wood for fence, good wood for fire.”

“Yeah,” Joseph agreed, without really knowing what he was agreeing to, so numb from the work.

The sun was high overhead and it was even warm where they stood together, admiring the morning’s work. The snow was already beginning to melt, cold drops of moisture glistening in the winter sunlight.


JOSEPH THE SON
Daniel Stepp

Chapter One

Four boys got off a school bus at the end of the dirt road that led a quarter mile back to Oakwood Estates, a trailer park that had been built on the abandoned Hight Farm property decades ago. The bus used to drive all the way to the mailboxes, but it had been years since anyone had bothered to gravel the road and there were deep ruts in many spots and hollowed out places with standing water, some a few feet deep.

Three of the boys walked together in a pack. The last followed behind at a distance that seemed conspicuously far.

It was a cool day but not cold. There was a field to their left which connected to several pastures fenced off from the others. Horses and cows. Some bales of hay. A distant barn. On their right a line of pine packs and tall grass obscured what lay beyond, but it was no mystery to them. 

At the corner of state road 53 and the dirt road was the local church, New Calvary Baptist Church. It was a plain brick and mortar building painted white. All church-going residents of Oakwood Estates attended New Calvary, which held services on Sunday morning and Wednesday evening. 

Behind the church itself was a small house and farm where the Pastor lived, a man named Jacob Brumbalow. He had been the pastor here for the last few years, an Alabamian by birth, a fact he could never quite live down. He was out in the yard behind his house this afternoon walking among his chickens. He fed them handfuls from a small burlap bag and they pecked greedily at his feet. Jacob waved to the boys but none of the pack of three acknowledged his wave and the last only nodded.

As soon as they were were sure Pastor Jacob could not see them, one of the boys in the pack of three pulled a round green can from his back pocket. He pinched off a plug of tobacco and passed the can around to the others. Soon after that he turned behind him and spit in the direction of the lone boy, giving him a hostile glare.

One of the others noticed and looked back. He stopped momentarily. The other two stopped also.

“Yo, want some dip?” The boy said. His name was Maurice Mayes, “It’s legit. Red Man Special.”

“He don’t want no dip,” one of the others said, “Look at him. He a mamas boy.”

The boy looked at the ground and did not answer. He kept walking and when he reached the others he went wide around them. Now he was in front of them.

The others grinned at one another and kept walking. The oldest boy, a fair-haired and lanky teen named Jesse Black picked up a rock and hurled it. The rock bounced off his heal, cutting him, but he did not, could not, acknowledge the pain.

“Better watch out Jesse,” said the Mexican kid, Ignacio Gomez, “He’s liable to knock you out.”

“He know better than that. He don’t wanna die.”

The others laughed.

The lone boy, Joseph, kept walking at an even pace. Slowly the others caught up to him. They made fun of his jacket, his hair, the way he walked. Jesse in particular antagonized him with threats and got even angrier when Joseph did not respond.

“Hey boy, I’m talking to you!” Jesse said, “Hey!”

“Hey,” Joseph said at last, but that was all.

Jesse stood in front of Joseph and both of them stopped. The others turned to watch.

“You a smart alec or something? I’ll break your fuckin jaw.”

Jesse took steps closer to Joseph, who continued to look at the ground in silence. He could smell a mixture of tobacco and body odor coming from Jesse and it made him want to wretch.

“Look at me boy.”

Joseph looked up and their eyes met. Jesse was taller, stronger, and his eyes meaner than his. They said nothing in words until the tension was unbearable.

“Yo check out that dog, man,” Maurice suddenly said, breaking the tension, “That’s an ugly dog. Where he came from I wonder?”

The other boys, including Joseph, looked at what Maurice had found. There on the road, limping along, was a mutt of some kind. Mangy. About half dead.

Jesse turned away from Joseph altogether and joined Maurice and Ignacio. They approached the dog from different angles, curious and cautious.

“Here boy,” Ignacio said, holding out his hand, “You’re good. You’re good.”

“Nice boy,” Maurice said.

The dog was afraid of them. It tried to creep into the high grass to hide but was too slow. Jesse jumped behind it and scared it in the other direction. Towards Joseph.

“Don’t let him get away!” Maurice shouted at Joseph.

Joseph, not knowing what to do, blocked the dog from sneaking around him. It was too weak to bite. You could see its ribs on the underbelly.

Now the others encircled the mutt in each direction. It turned to see that it was trapped. Ignacio grabbed some sticks from a pile of brush and tossed them to the others, to Joseph.

“Keep him still,” Maurice said, “Don’t let him get past you.”

“That’s the game,” Ignacio said, laughing.

“If he gets by you,” Maurice hesitated, a loss of words.

“If he gets by you what?” Jesse said.

“If he gets by you, you gotta lick a cat’s butthole.”

The boys all laughed.

As the mutt approached any one of them he batted his stick on the ground and that frightened it in the opposite direction. After a few minutes of this it became clear they would be there for a long time if that was the only game to be played. But no boy wanted to be the one to let the dog get away.

Joseph caught eyes with Jesse and saw hostility. They were not friends. Their confrontation from minutes ago was not forgotten in his eyes. He felt strange. Outside himself. But laughed along with them as if he were one of them.

At that point Ignacio let his guard down and the dog slipped by him and scurried further down the road.

“Get him!”

“Don’t let him get away!”

One of the dog’s feet was injured so it wasn’t hard to get around in front of him and block the way. Joseph and Jesse ran the fastest. Maurice grabbed his book bag and stood behind, while Ignacio came around the side. Before long they had the dog encircled once again.

Maurice said, “This game old man. How bout we do something else? I got an idea.”

“What you got?”

Maurice reached behind him and unzipped the small pouch on his bag. He pulled out a small binder clip.

“Okay,” he said, “This is the game. One of you has to put this clip on that dogs tail. Whoever does that is the bravest one.”

“Man, you’re crazy,” Ignacio said, “that dog will bite the hell out of you, if you get that close. Look how mad he is already.”

“Scared,” Jesse said, taunting him.

“You do it,” Ignacio said.

“I ain’t stupid.”

“Look,” Maurice said, “I got five dollars whoever do it.”

“Quit lyin.”

“For real. Mom gave me cash for meal tickets this week but I didn’t buy them yet.”

“No, I know,” Jesse said, “let this new guy do it. He has to do it. Neighborhood code.”

“Oh,” Ignacio said, nodding, “Yeah, neighborhood code. New guy has to do it. Initiation.”

Joseph looked at the others, at the clip, and at the dog.

“No way. I can’t do that.”

“Why not?” Jesse said, “You chickenshit?”

“I ain’t chickenshit.”

“Then prove it, son,” Maurice said.

“Yeah prove it,” Ignacio repeated.

Joseph looked down the road. He was still far from the old farmhouse where his family lived. Those boys could catch him for sure if he bolted now. And he felt sure they would chase him. Something in their eyes told him. And a part of him wanted to belong, wanted to show them he wasn’t afraid.

He took the clip from Maurice as the others circled tighter around the dog. He had to squeeze with most fingers against his palm to apply enough force to open the clip. The dog looked up in fear at each of them. Joseph took a cautious step forward, awaiting the right moment when the dog’s tail was nearest to him.

“This about to get real.”

“Do it, chickenshit.”

It only took a second for him to reach down and clip the tail, and it caught somewhere in the middle. Gripped it good. The dog immediately panicked and yelped in a high pitch that echoed across the empty field. They boys jumped backwards and stood there watching. Laughing.

Round and round the dog spun, biting at its tail, but it was no good. The clip had a good five pounds of pressure on it, and the dog could not reach it as high up as it was. It growled and yelped until it wore itself out, and then it kept going.

Joseph looked at the dog in horror. He wanted to help it but as fast as it was spinning there was nothing to be done. It would bite for sure now, and bite hard. For survival. So he did nothing except laugh along with the others.

Then somewhere up the road they heard a voice shouting. The pastor Jacob had heard the dog in pain and ran up to meet them.

“What’s going on here?” Jacob shouted, “What have you boys done?”

As soon as he saw the dog, he knelt beside it on one knee and gripped it hard around the torso, removing the clip and releasing the dog in one movement. And just like that the dog was gone, vanishing into the high yellow grass. The pastor held up the binder clip and showed it to them. He then heaved it into the tree packs where it could never be found.

Jacob stood tall. His eyes lifted towards those gray November skies. And then he shut them as if in prayer. At the horizon a mid-afternoon sunlight fell sharply across the landscape and lit everything unnaturally bright. The pastor’s hands were covered in grime and there was a wound on his left palm. Blood from it intermingled with the grease and dirt and ran a thin river up his forearm. He wrung both hands together, unaware of the injury he had sustained. His breathing was slow, but deep. He did not address the boys right away. He only stood there in a kind of reverie.

A small wind rustled the leaves on the ground and swept across the field grass.

None of the boys dared to speak. Not amongst themselves and not to pastor Jacob. The wild mood from before was gone and it had been replaced with a certain kind of silence. A stillness. Joseph caught eyes with Jesse who immediately looked away. The others stared at the ground.

Then Pastor Jacob opened his eyes and looked at each one of them. Then he spoke.

“Augustine, the Saint, wrote that if it were possible for every sound to become silent and for every movement to become still, in all of creation, then the truth of our existence would be revealed to us. Everything would speak at once, in the same voice. We did not create ourselves. We were made by Him who abideth in Eternity.”

“Creation. You. Me. This dirt road at our feet. The grass. The clouds. The sun. Those chickens. That poor dog. There is a kinship here. It is deeper than species. It is deeper than blood. There is an understanding of life that cannot be taught. It must be understood. You Jesse and you Maurice, you Ignacio, and you, what is your name, son?”

“Joseph.”

“You Joseph, all of you boys are a part of this world. And you share a kinship with everything you meet under the one Creator. And what is your duty towards your kin?”

None of the boys would speak, and after a long period of silence Jacob continued.

“Your duty to your kin is to protect them. To shelter them from harm. Human beings have powerful, powerful minds and we have constructed elaborate systems in the forms of laws and religions to convince ourselves we are not responsible for all, only those of our own species, family, race, culture, religion, society. But that is the lie. That is the lie and each man knows it from the bottom of his heart. And it is a great sin.”

Jacob was breathless for a moment, lost in another world somewhere. As he returned to the dirt road beside the field, among the four boys, he looked around, stupefied. Unaware of his surroundings.

The boys all looked at the ground. All but one. Joseph was looking right into his eyes and they connected.

“I understand you.”

The pastor kneeled beside Joseph and gazed sincerely at him. Joseph did not look away.

“Yes,” Jacob smiled, clasping one hand around his shoulder and gently squeezing, “I see by your eyes that you do.”

“You boys,” Jacob said, rising from his knee, “there is work to be done for Cornucopia and I think it would be a good thing in light of what happened today for each of you to come work on the church grounds this weekend, at my farm. Tell your folks I said so. I’ll be coming around your houses this evening to make sure you told.”

The tone of Jacob’s voice had returned to normal. He came back from the place of inspiration from which he had just been speaking from. The boys noticed and respected his sincerity and the authority he commanded. They nodded in unison and turned down the road towards Oakwood Estates. Joseph followed them but the pastor stopped him.

“Joseph, wait just a minute, please.”

“Sir?”

“I don’t know your folks, I don’t believe. Do you live in Oakwood? Are you new to the area?”

“I live in the house on the hill, past the trailer park. We moved there a couple months ago.”

“The old Hight Farm house? I didn’t think that place was habitable anymore. Looks abandoned.”

“Yes sir. It needs work.”

“I suppose so. Don’t think anyone’s lived there for years.”

Jacob looked past the trailer park and saw the old farmhouse up on the rise.

“Well,” he said, “I’d like to introduce myself to your folks and tell them about what I saw today. I’d like to speak to your daddy. Do you mind if I walked with you home?”

“Yes sir. I mean, no sir. I don’t mind.”

Jacob smiled. He ruffled the hair on Joseph’s head. Joseph smiled back at him.

“You lead the way then.”

They both set off in the direction of the trailer park and the old farmhouse, not too far behind the other boys.



Chapter Two


A woman came to the screen door and was surprised to see her son standing there with a strange man in work clothes. Jacob nodded to her and Joseph tried not to make eye contact. She opened the door part way and motioned for Joseph to come to her side. Not wanting her to get the wrong impression, Jacob spoke first.

“Ma’am, I’m sorry to interrupt your day. I was wondering if I might speak to the boy’s father for just a moment. There was an incident on the road just now and Joseph-“

“I’m the boy’s mother and you may speak with me if you like. His father is not around, I’m afraid.”

Jacob frowned. He placed his hands deep in both pockets and looked at his shirt.

“Ma’am, I feel like an utter fool. It was presumptuous of me to bypass your authority. Please forgive me.”

Joseph’s mother opened the door further. She looked at the man and then at Joseph, trying to make sense of things.

“I’m Beth. Beth Hight.”

“Jacob Brumbalow. Pastor in residence at New Calvary Baptist Church, right at the end of the road.”

“Oh yes, New Calvary. Of course I know the place. My co-worker Elise goes there.”

“Elise Mullins?”

“That’s right.”

“A good family, the Mullins.”

“She’s a sweet lady.”

“Yes ma’am.”

A moment of reflection and their attention returned to Joseph. Beth opened the door and came out onto the porch.

“Ma’am, about your son. I don’t want to keep you, but I felt compelled to let you know what happened.”

“Please do, Pastor. I hope nothing serious.”

She gave Joseph a stern glance and Joseph shrugged.

“Your son and a few other boys from Oakwood Estates were torturing a stray dog there on the road. I saw them from my farm while I was feeding my chickens. They had sticks and one of the boys had put one of those clip binders on its tail. Thing was spinning in circles trying to get it loose. It was in a lot of pain.”

“Oh my Lord,” Beth said, turning to Joseph, “You are not raised like that, young man. We don’t torture animals. You are better than that. You hear me?”

Joseph did not answer. Beth was visible upset and faced Jacob.

“Mr. Brumbalow, I am so sorry. I want to thank you for stopping them and for taking the time to walk up here and let me know. He  really is not like that. I don’t know what to say exactly.”

“Ma’am, please don’t feel you have to say anything. I will be honest. After talking with Joseph I think he just fell in with the wrong group of boys this time. Joseph has a good heart. He’s not like those other boys, Jesse Black and his gang. He has a heart that walks with God. Anybody can see that.”

Beth blushed at his sincerity. She pulled Joseph closer to her, but he pulled away.

“Thank you for saying that, Mr. Brumbalow.”

“Please call me Jacob.”

“Thank you, Mr. Jacob.”

Silence, then she said, “May I get you something to drink before you go? We have coffee and tea. Maybe coke.”

“I never turn down a cup of coffee, especially on days like this. It’s not cold per se but if you stay outdoors long enough the chill gets inside your bones.”

“I know just what you mean. It’s colder than a witches titty around here lately.”

Joseph laughed and looked embarrassed. Jacob laughed too. Beth went inside while Joseph and Jacob lingered on the porch. 

Jacob admired the build of the house, a depression era architecture, simple wood frame, not much changed from its original materials. Much that was not painted was dry-rotted and what was painted was chipped and flaking off. The years of neglect were apparent. On the porch was a strange rocking chair with tire treads for rockers and a two-person swing that had fallen, a rusty single-gear bicycle, and some coffee tins that had been obviously been used for target practice a long time ago.

Beth called out from the kitchen, “How do you take it, Mr. Jacob?”

“Two sugars, no cream.”

A minute later Beth emerged with two mugs, steaming. She handed one to Jacob and set the other on a nearby window ceil. Turning to Joseph, who was not paying attention to their conversation anymore, “Why don’t you go mind Lizzie for awhile.”

Joseph nodded and headed indoors, but his mother stopped him.

“Tell Mr. Jacob you are sorry.”

Joseph went to Jacob and met his expectant eyes.

“I’m sorry for what I did.”

“You are forgiven, Mr. Joseph. I will see you bright and early tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow for what?” Beth asked.

“Forgive me again, Ms. Hight. We need some help to prepare for our Fall Festival upcoming and I figured some manual labor could do these boys some good.”

“Say no more. Joseph will be there. Won’t you Joseph?”

“Yes, ma’am.”
