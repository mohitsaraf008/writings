It was still dark when grandpa came to wake him. 

“Slip on your long johns,” he whispered with a finger held to his mouth, “and try not to wake Lizzie, savvy?”

At that he left the room.

The boy rolled from under the warmth of his sleeping bag onto the cold wood. Wobbling in place for nearly a minute he finally became conscious enough to feel how cold it was in the room. He kicked his legs in place and rubbed his bare arms together to get some circulation going. Once his eyes had become adjusted to what little light there was he crept over to the chest of drawers. He pulled open the middle drawer but it creaked despite his most cautious movement. He winced and went utterly still, but his sister didn’t stir. After a moment he slid on his long johns and then a few more layers of pants, shirts, a sweater. He grabbed his survival knife from its place on the nightstand and joined his grandfather in the main room.

Heat from the stove in the kitchen enveloped him as he came up behind his grandfather at the table and stood there, not fully awake.

“Hold out your arms,” Grandpa said. He noticed Joseph nodding in place, his eyes nearly shut, so he gave one his cheeks a good pinch. His eyes opened wide.

“Hold out your arms.”

In them he placed a newly-sharpened ax, some length of twine, and a rolled up tarp. Joseph could barely carry it all, but shuffled them around until he had a good hold. Grandpa watched him with some amusement.

“Got your knife on you?”

“Yes sir.”

“Biscuit?”

“Yes.”

Grandpa buttered one of the drop biscuits Beth had made the day before, hardened now, but still edible. As Joseph could not carry the biscuit his grandfather placed it in his mouth.

“Ready?”

Joseph mumbled.

“Let’s do it then.”

Out the front door they went but turned left from the porch and  headed towards the shed. There was no moonlight this time of morning and sunlight was just a sliver behind the line of trees on the hills in the distance. But even that was enough to illuminate the snow on the ground and light their way.

Their footsteps crunching through snow and ice was the only sound to be heard this early morning. Their slow but steady march the only movement. Everything else was silent and still on the hill where they lived.

Joseph breathed through an old t-shirt he used to cover his mouth and neck area. He smelled the old sweat warmed by his breath but it was not unpleasant as it reminded him of summer days. His exhalation made a visible puff of air each time, and he noticed his grandfather’s breath do the same.

They walked past the shed to the edge of the woods. It was darker in the woods, but grandfather didn’t miss a step as he stomped a few briars to make a path through for them.

By this point Joseph was not paying much attention to where they were, only following the back of his grandfather’s coat, which he could barely make out, the rough wool material came nearly to his knees. So when his grandfather switched on the flashlight and lit up a ten foot area in front of them, it startled him at first.

The winter woods lit by the flashlight appeared to him to be some alien landscape. Bizarre and menacing. A haze floated through the air, snow or dust they had kicked up. The space between the maples and pines was enough to easily walk through, except for the briars. Luckily grandpa carried a machete and wore his boots.

Another five minutes of walking and they were deep enough so that when Joseph looked back he could no longer see the lights from the kitchen window. All the time the place was getting brighter but here it was still too dark to see, canopied over by the tall trees.

Joseph knew what they were looking for this far in the woods. His grandfather made rounds every few weeks through the woods with two of spray paint and marked ones he thought would make the best firewood and others for carpentry work. He had a system. Orange for firewood. Blue for carpentry. They had passed several orange-marked trees already, but they had not yet seen a blue one.

At one point grandpa stopped and Joseph, not paying attention, ran straight into him and dropped the ax. Grandpa turned around harshly and picked up the ax, then returned to the woods and scratched his head. He shone his light in all directions and finally it landed on a particular midsize pine among several others. On its trunk was a blue ‘X’. They set to work. 

Joseph unfurled the tarp onto the ground while grandfather started chipping away at one side of the tree with ax in one hand, flashlight in the other. Once the cut path was established, grandfather handed the ax to Joseph, showed him how to hold it properly and where to hit on the tree and at what angle. Then he held the flashlight up while Joseph took his swings. The young boy swung wildly but making enough progress with just shear force.

“Don’t wear yourself out,” Grandpa said, “You’re gonna need the strength later.”

Thirty minutes passed and the morning light shone through the bare branches. They no longer needed the flashlight, dim though the light still was. Both grandpa and Joseph had taken turns and were both well tired. Joseph tried do more but his arm was just about give out. Grandpa pushed him on seeing how close they were, the wedge-shaped angle had just about reached the other side.

And then it cracked. Joseph stood back and his grandfather put his boot on the chopped side and pushed.

“Give it a push, Joseph.”

They both pushed the tree hard and finally gave it enough momentum to tear. The tree cracked and fell slow and hard onto the ground, just missing a nearby oak.

After a rest Grandpa picked up the ax and walked a length from the base to about ten foot. At that point he made a notch with the ax and gave a few swings.

“We’ll cut her here, split the log, and then come back later for the rest as firewood. Savvy?”

“Yes sir.”

Joseph took that as his cue to pick up the ax again. For the next hour they took turns chopping through the log, and then once chopped to the right length driving a wedge into a gap and splitting it lengthwise, first into two, then into four.

By now it was morning. A pale light fell over the trees and the ground, covered with snow in places. Joseph looked at his grandfather. He was tired and ready to call it a day. But he knew they still had much to do. His grandfather smiled at him and told him to be tough.

They pulled the split logs onto the tarp and then each grabbed a corner and started the drag out of the woods. It was slow-going but easier than they thought it would be, as heavy as the logs were. They dragged and dragged. Joseph pulled off his cap and the shirt from his neck. He was sweating.

Soon they came to the edge of the woods. Joseph could see his mother in the kitchen from here, now that it was light. She was preparing breakfast. Lizzie was crying for something at her feet. He wanted grandpa to tell them to quit so they could have breakfast and rest. But he couldn’t say so himself. He knew that.

Once they were on the snow the drag was much easier. They pulled it past the shed and over to the fence separating their land from the large field. The broken section was just as it was left, the rotten wood disintegrated into pieces at the post hole.

They pulled the rotten fence rails from the post holes and cleaned it out. The rails fell apart in their hands it was so far gone. “Past time for this,” Grandpa remarked. Joseph nodded in agreement, although really his mind was on eggs and bacon, and fresh biscuits.

The area now clean from all the old rails, they did some last-minute trimming on the new rail ends, just so they would fit into the existing post holes. Then they lifted each end into place, starting at the bottom. Then once that one was in place, it was that much easier to do the next one, resting it on the lower rail.

Once all four rails were in place, grandpa got the roll of twine and told Joseph to get out his knife. Grandpa unspooled about three feet of twine and held it out for Joseph to cut. Joseph flipped open the rusty blade (still sharp) and cut the twine. Then grandpa wrapped it around each post rail join in a figure eight, tucking in the end. He showed Joseph how this was done and they each took another post rail join and finished in less than half an hour.

Once finished, grandpa took a step back and asked Joseph to stand with him. They admired their work. It had taken all morning, nearly five hours. Then they put the old rails onto the tarp and pulled it over to the firepit and unloaded it.

“Bad wood for fence, good wood for fire.”

“Yeah,” Joseph agreed, without really knowing what he was agreeing to, so numb from the work.

The sun was high overhead and it was even warm where they stood together, admiring the morning’s work. The snow was already beginning to melt, cold drops of moisture glistening in the winter sunlight.


JOSEPH THE SON
Daniel Stepp


Chapter One

Four boys got off a school bus at the end of the dirt road that led a quarter mile back to Oakwood Estates, a trailer park that had been built on the abandoned Hight Farm property decades ago. The bus used to drive all the way to the mailboxes, but it had been years since anyone had bothered to gravel the road and there were deep ruts in many spots and hollowed out places with standing water, some a few feet deep.

Three of the boys walked together in a pack. The last followed behind at a distance that seemed conspicuously far.

It was a cool day but not cold. There was a field to their left which connected to several pastures fenced off from the others. Horses and cows. Some bales of hay. A distant barn. On their right a line of pine packs and tall grass obscured what lay beyond, but it was no mystery to them. 

At the corner of state road 53 and the dirt road was the local church, New Calvary Baptist Church. It was a plain brick and mortar building painted white. All church-going residents of Oakwood Estates attended New Calvary, which held services on Sunday morning and Wednesday evening. 

Behind the church itself was a small house and farm where the Pastor lived, a man named Jacob Brumbalow. He had been the pastor here for the last few years, an Alabamian by birth, a fact he could never quite live down. He was out in the yard behind his house this afternoon walking among his chickens. He fed them handfuls from a small burlap bag and they pecked greedily at his feet. Jacob waved to the boys but none of the pack of three acknowledged his wave and the last only nodded.

As soon as they were were sure Pastor Jacob could not see them, one of the boys in the pack of three pulled a round green can from his back pocket. He pinched off a plug of tobacco and passed the can around to the others. Soon after that he turned behind him and spit in the direction of the lone boy, giving him a hostile glare.

One of the others noticed and looked back. He stopped momentarily. The other two stopped also.

“Yo, want some dip?” The boy said. His name was Maurice Mayes, “It’s legit. Red Man Special.”

“He don’t want no dip,” one of the others said, “Look at him. He a mamas boy.”

The boy looked at the ground and did not answer. He kept walking and when he reached the others he went wide around them. Now he was in front of them.

The others grinned at one another and kept walking. The oldest boy, a fair-haired and lanky teen named Jesse Black picked up a rock and hurled it. The rock bounced off his heal, cutting him, but he did not, could not, acknowledge the pain.

“Better watch out Jesse,” said the Mexican kid, Ignacio Gomez, “He’s liable to knock you out.”

“He know better than that. He don’t wanna die.”

The others laughed.

The lone boy, Joseph, kept walking at an even pace. Slowly the others caught up to him. They made fun of his jacket, his hair, the way he walked. Jesse in particular antagonized him with threats and got even angrier when Joseph did not respond.

“Hey boy, I’m talking to you!” Jesse said, “Hey!”

“Hey,” Joseph said at last, but that was all.

Jesse stood in front of Joseph and both of them stopped. The others turned to watch.

“You a smart alec or something? I’ll break your fuckin jaw.”

Jesse took steps closer to Joseph, who continued to look at the ground in silence. He could smell a mixture of tobacco and body odor coming from Jesse and it made him want to wretch.

“Look at me boy.”

Joseph looked up and their eyes met. Jesse was taller, stronger, and his eyes meaner than his. They said nothing in words until the tension was unbearable.

“Yo check out that dog, man,” Maurice suddenly said, breaking the tension, “That’s an ugly dog. Where he came from I wonder?”

The other boys, including Joseph, looked at what Maurice had found. There on the road, limping along, was a mutt of some kind. Mangy. About half dead.

Jesse turned away from Joseph altogether and joined Maurice and Ignacio. They approached the dog from different angles, curious and cautious.

“Here boy,” Ignacio said, holding out his hand, “You’re good. You’re good.”

“Nice boy,” Maurice said.

The dog was afraid of them. It tried to creep into the high grass to hide but was too slow. Jesse jumped behind it and scared it in the other direction. Towards Joseph.

“Don’t let him get away!” Maurice shouted at Joseph.

Joseph, not knowing what to do, blocked the dog from sneaking around him. It was too weak to bite. You could see its ribs on the underbelly.

Now the others encircled the mutt in each direction. It turned to see that it was trapped. Ignacio grabbed some sticks from a pile of brush and tossed them to the others, to Joseph.

“Keep him still,” Maurice said, “Don’t let him get past you.”

“That’s the game,” Ignacio said, laughing.

“If he gets by you,” Maurice hesitated, a loss of words.

“If he gets by you what?” Jesse said.

“If he gets by you, you gotta lick a cat’s butthole.”

The boys all laughed.

As the mutt approached any one of them he batted his stick on the ground and that frightened it in the opposite direction. After a few minutes of this it became clear they would be there for a long time if that was the only game to be played. But no boy wanted to be the one to let the dog get away.

Joseph caught eyes with Jesse and saw hostility. They were not friends. Their confrontation from minutes ago was not forgotten in his eyes. He felt strange. Outside himself. But laughed along with them as if he were one of them.

At that point Ignacio let his guard down and the dog slipped by him and scurried further down the road.

“Get him!”

“Don’t let him get away!”

One of the dog’s feet was injured so it wasn’t hard to get around in front of him and block the way. Joseph and Jesse ran the fastest. Maurice grabbed his book bag and stood behind, while Ignacio came around the side. Before long they had the dog encircled once again.

Maurice said, “This game old man. How bout we do something else? I got an idea.”

“What you got?”

Maurice reached behind him and unzipped the small pouch on his bag. He pulled out a small binder clip.

“Okay,” he said, “This is the game. One of you has to put this clip on that dogs tail. Whoever does that is the bravest one.”

“Man, you’re crazy,” Ignacio said, “that dog will bite the hell out of you, if you get that close. Look how mad he is already.”

“Scared,” Jesse said, taunting him.

“You do it,” Ignacio said.

“I ain’t stupid.”

“Look,” Maurice said, “I got five dollars whoever do it.”

“Quit lyin.”

“For real. Mom gave me cash for meal tickets this week but I didn’t buy them yet.”

“No, I know,” Jesse said, “let this new guy do it. He has to do it. Neighborhood code.”

“Oh,” Ignacio said, nodding, “Yeah, neighborhood code. New guy has to do it. Initiation.”

Joseph looked at the others, at the clip, and at the dog.

“No way. I can’t do that.”

“Why not?” Jesse said, “You chickenshit?”

“I ain’t chickenshit.”

“Then prove it, son,” Maurice said.

“Yeah prove it,” Ignacio repeated.

Joseph looked down the road. He was still far from the old farmhouse where his family lived. Those boys could catch him for sure if he bolted now. And he felt sure they would chase him. Something in their eyes told him. And a part of him wanted to belong, wanted to show them he wasn’t afraid.

He took the clip from Maurice as the others circled tighter around the dog. He had to squeeze with most fingers against his palm to apply enough force to open the clip. The dog looked up in fear at each of them. Joseph took a cautious step forward, awaiting the right moment when the dog’s tail was nearest to him.

“This about to get real.”

“Do it, chickenshit.”

It only took a second for him to reach down and clip the tail, and it caught somewhere in the middle. Gripped it good. The dog immediately panicked and yelped in a high pitch that echoed across the empty field. They boys jumped backwards and stood there watching. Laughing.

Round and round the dog spun, biting at its tail, but it was no good. The clip had a good five pounds of pressure on it, and the dog could not reach it as high up as it was. It growled and yelped until it wore itself out, and then it kept going.

Joseph looked at the dog in horror. He wanted to help it but as fast as it was spinning there was nothing to be done. It would bite for sure now, and bite hard. For survival. So he did nothing except laugh along with the others.

Then somewhere up the road they heard a voice shouting. The pastor Jacob had heard the dog in pain and ran up to meet them.

“What’s going on here?” Jacob shouted, “What have you boys done?”

As soon as he saw the dog, he knelt beside it on one knee and gripped it hard around the torso, removing the clip and releasing the dog in one movement. And just like that the dog was gone, vanishing into the high yellow grass. The pastor held up the binder clip and showed it to them. He then heaved it into the tree packs where it could never be found.

Jacob stood tall. His eyes lifted towards the gray November skiy. And then he shut them as if in prayer. At the horizon a mid-afternoon sunlight fell sharply across the landscape and lit everything unnaturally bright. The pastor’s hands were covered in grime and there was a wound on his left palm. Blood from it intermingled with the grease and dirt and ran a thin river up his forearm. He wrung both hands together, unaware of the injury he had sustained. His breathing was slow, but deep. He did not address the boys right away. He only stood there in a kind of reverie.

A small wind rustled the leaves on the ground and swept across the field grass.

None of the boys dared to speak. Not amongst themselves and not to pastor Jacob. The wild mood from before was gone and it had been replaced with a certain kind of silence. A stillness. Joseph caught eyes with Jesse who immediately looked away. The others stared at the ground.

Then Pastor Jacob opened his eyes and looked at each one of them. Then he spoke.

“Augustine the Saint wrote that if it were possible for every sound to become silent and for every movement to become still, in all of creation, then the truth of our existence would be revealed to us. Everything would speak at once, in the same voice. We did not create ourselves. We were made by Him who abideth in Eternity.”

“Creation. You. Me. This dirt road at our feet. The grass. The clouds. The sun. Those chickens. That poor dog. There is a kinship here. It is deeper than species. It is deeper than blood. There is an understanding of life that cannot be taught. It must be understood. You Jesse and you Maurice, you Ignacio, and you, what is your name, son?”

“Joseph.”

“You Joseph, all of you boys are a part of this world. And you share a kinship with everything you meet under the one Creator. And what is your duty towards your kin?”

None of the boys would speak, and after a long period of silence Jacob continued.

“Your duty to your kin is to protect them. To shelter them from harm. Human beings have powerful, powerful minds and we have constructed elaborate systems in the forms of laws and religions to convince ourselves we are not responsible for all, only those of our own species, family, race, culture, religion, society. But that is the lie. That is the lie and each man knows it from the bottom of his heart. And it is a great sin.”

Jacob was breathless for a moment, lost in another world somewhere. As he returned to the dirt road beside the field, among the four boys, he looked around, stupefied. Unaware of his surroundings.

The boys all looked at the ground. All but one. Joseph was looking right into his eyes and they connected.

“I understand you.”

The pastor kneeled beside Joseph and gazed sincerely at him. Joseph did not look away.

“Yes,” Jacob smiled, clasping one hand around his shoulder and gently squeezing, “I see by your eyes that you do.”

“You boys,” Jacob said, rising from his knee, “there is work to be done for Cornucopia and I think it would be a good thing in light of what happened today for each of you to come work on the church grounds this weekend, at my farm. Tell your folks I said so. I’ll be coming around your houses this evening to make sure you told.”

The tone of Jacob’s voice had returned to normal. He came back from the place of inspiration from which he had just been speaking from. The boys noticed and respected his sincerity and the authority he commanded. They nodded in unison and turned down the road towards Oakwood Estates. Joseph followed them but the pastor stopped him.

“Joseph, wait just a minute, please.”

“Sir?”

“I don’t know your folks, I don’t believe. Do you live in Oakwood? Are you new to the area?”

“I live in the house on the hill, past the trailer park. We moved there a couple months ago.”

“The old Hight Farm house? I didn’t think that place was habitable anymore. Looks abandoned.”

“Yes sir. It needs work.”

“I suppose so. Don’t think anyone’s lived there for years.”

Jacob looked past the trailer park and saw the old farmhouse up on the rise.

“Well,” he said, “I’d like to introduce myself to your folks and tell them about what I saw today. I’d like to speak to your daddy. Do you mind if I walked with you home?”

“Yes sir. I mean, no sir. I don’t mind.”

Jacob smiled. He ruffled the hair on Joseph’s head. Joseph smiled back at him.

“You lead the way then.”

They both set off in the direction of the trailer park and the old farmhouse, not too far behind the other boys.



Chapter Two


A woman came to the screen door and was shocked to see her son standing there with a strange man in work clothes. She was dressed in a house dress and slippers, her hair held up above her neck in bobby pins. From within the smell of roast chicken and vegetables. Jacob nodded to her politely but Joseph would not make eye contact. She parted the door and motioned for Joseph to come to her side. He did so. Not wanting her to get the wrong impression, Jacob spoke first.

“Ma’am, I’m sorry to interrupt your day. I was wondering if I might speak to the boy’s father for just a moment. There was an incident on the road just now and Joseph-“

“I’m the boy’s mother and you may speak with me if you like. His father is not around, I’m afraid.”

Jacob frowned. He placed his hands deep in both pockets and looked at his shirt.

“Ma’am, already I feel like an utter fool. It was presumptuous of me to bypass your authority without understanding the situation. Please forgive me.”

Joseph’s mother opened the door further. She looked at the man and then at Joseph, trying to make sense of things. The low sunlight beamed across the porch onto her face. She shielded herself with one hand.

“I’m Beth. Beth Hight.”

“Jacob Brumbalow. Pastor in residence at New Calvary Baptist Church, right at the end of the road.”

“Oh yes, New Calvary. Of course I know the place. My co-worker Margaret goes there.”

“Margaret Foy?”

“That’s right.”

“A good family, the Foys.”

“She’s a sweet lady.”

“Yes ma’am.”

A moment of reflection on both parts and then their attention returned to Joseph. Beth opened the door and came out onto the porch. Joseph followed behind. His eyes never left the ground.

“Ma’am, about your son. I don’t want to keep you, but I felt compelled to let you know what happened.”

“Please do, Pastor. I hope nothing serious.”

“Well, I hate to say, but your son and a few other boys from Oakwood Estates were just now torturing a stray dog there on the road. I saw them from my farm while I was feeding my chickens. They had sticks and one of the boys had put one of those clip binders on its tail. Thing was spinning in circles trying to get it loose. It was in a lot of pain. That was clear.”

“Oh my goodness,” Beth said, turning to Joseph, “You were not raised like that, young man. We don’t torture animals. You are better than that. You hear me?”

Joseph did not answer. Beth was visibly upset and faced Jacob with an apologetic expression.

“Mr. Brumbalow, I am so sorry. I want to thank you for stopping them and for taking the time to walk up here and let me know. He  really is not like that. I don’t know what to say exactly.”

“Ma’am, please don’t feel you have to say anything. I will be honest. After speaking with Joseph I think this is just a case where he fell in with the wrong group of boys, unfortunately. Joseph has a good heart. He’s not like those other boys, Jesse Black and his gang. He has a heart that walks with God. Anybody can see that.”

Beth blushed at his uncommon sincerity. She pulled Joseph closer to her but he flinched and stood over by the porch railing.

“Thank you for saying that, Mr. Brumbalow.”

Jacob shrugged.

“Please call me Jacob.”

“Thank you, Mr. Jacob.”

Silence passed between them, and then she said, “May I get you something to drink before you take off? We have coffee and tea. Maybe some coke.”

“I never turn down a cup of coffee, especially on days like this. Not cold per se but if you stay outdoors long enough that chill gets inside your bones.”

“I know just what you mean. It’s colder than a witches titty around here lately. That’s what we say in Georgia.”

Joseph was embarrassed. Jacob laughed. Beth disappeared inside while Joseph and Jacob lingered on the porch. They did not speak.

Jacob admired the build of the house, a depression era architecture, simple wood frame, not much changed from its original materials. Much that was not painted was dry-rotted and what was painted was chipped and flaking off. The years of neglect were apparent. On the porch was a strange rocking chair with tire treads for rockers and a two-person swing that had fallen, a rusty single-gear bicycle, and some coffee tins that had been obviously been used for target practice a long time ago.

Beth called out from the kitchen, “How do you take it, Mr. Jacob?”

“Two sugars, no cream.”

A minute later Beth emerged with two mugs, steaming. She handed one to Jacob and set the other on a nearby window ceil. Turning to Joseph, who was not paying attention to their conversation anymore, “Why don’t you go mind Lizzie for awhile.”

Joseph nodded and headed indoors, but his mother stopped him.

“Tell Mr. Jacob you are sorry.”

Joseph went to Jacob and met his expectant eyes.

“I’m sorry for what I did.”

“You are forgiven, Mr. Joseph. I will see you bright and early tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow for what?” Beth asked.

“Forgive me again, Ms. Hight. We need some help to prepare for our Fall Festival upcoming and I figured some manual labor might do these boys some good. I’m sorry if I’m overstepping my boundaries.”

“Say no more. He’ll be there. Won’t you Joseph?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Joseph went indoors, leaving Jacob and Beth on the porch. With him gone neither seemed sure where to take the conversation. Jacob studied the porch as if he were a carpenter. Beth watched him and nervously looked to see if Joseph was still in the kitchen, but he wasn’t.

“Boy I tell you-“ Jacob began.

“What’s that?”

“Well I was just going to say,” Jacob started again, not put off by the interjection, “They sure don’t build them like this anymore.”

“I guess not.”

“This is something else. Like looking at history. Like time travel. In this country our buildings are tore down and rebuilt so often its rare to see a place that’s been around like this one. This must be from the depression, at least.”

“I don’t really know. It looks it for sure.”

Jacob laughed, “Well, that’s to be expected. Would you mind if I took a walk around to check it out?”

“Well, okay. I’ll walk with you.”

The pastor stepped aside to allow Beth to descend the steps first and then followed, still admiring the porch framework.

They walked around the East side where a small shed sat close to the woods. There was an old Ford tractor half-covered with a canvas tarp under a makeshift work area. Jacob took off in that direction.

“Do you know what this is?”

“I don’t guess.”

“This is a Ford 9N. From the forties. Does it run?”

“I have no idea. My guess would be no.”

Jacob returned, glancing back at it. They continued around. He kept close to the house, admiring it, inspecting the little details. The wood around the base of the house was overgrown with lichens, clearly rotted away. The once white paint was cracked all over, dried into tiny shards that peeled off with your fingernail. The windows covered in a milky haze.

“Not sure why you’re so impressed with this place.”

Jacob stopped to consider her words and then replied, “I guess I’ve always been attracted to places like this. Abandoned factories, ruins of old towns, deserted Main Streets. You know? It seems a strange thing to love them. But I do. It makes me feel connected to the transience of all worldly things. In that way I feel closer to God.”

Beth had no reply. Jacob seemed embarrassed to have revealed it to her. They continued walking.

In the back of the house there was a small porch area with an iron table and chairs and some brick steps leading to the back entryway. But what stood out was a massive Water Oak tree that rested against the side of the house, collapsing the upper side where wall met roof. The tree was dried and rotted through. Clearly this had occurred years ago. A few small branches lay in a pile next to the tree, recently cut. Against the house was an ax.

“Would you look at that.”

“I guess you’re wondering why on Earth we’d move into a house in this condition?”

“Among other things,” said Jacob, ducking under the trunk and walking the length of the tree to the exposed roots, all tangles and clods of earth spiraling in a hundred different directions.

Beth joined him there and they both looked up the length of the tree where it spread into a fan of dead limbs and twigs, leaves. It almost seemed to be a part of the roof whose shingles were peeled off in places, as dry and old as the tree. From here you could see into the attic space where they tree had broken through, water-damaged cardboard boxes, a lamp stand, somebody’s old wig.

“Why do you live here?” Jacob asked.

“Necessity. This is my father-in-law’s farm. Ken Hight. He sold off this land in pieces throughout the sixties and seventies, then moved out all together in the late eighties. After my husband Will left for an oil field job in North Dakota last year and never came back, Mr. Hight became sick, so sick he couldn’t care for himself anymore. Water on the brain. You ever heard of that? There is a name for it, but I don’t remember-”

“Hydrocephalus,” Jacob said, “my uncle had that at one time. There is treatment though if I remember right.”

“If you are a reasonable person, sure. But I guess you haven’t met Mr. Ken Hight.” 

Beth laughed but there was no joy in her laughter. Jacob smiled kindly, his eyes drawn down. His hands clenched nervously together.

“I imagine that big gaping hole doesn’t help the insulation. Has it been cold for you this fall?”

“Like you wouldn’t believe. There is a wood stove in the kitchen that can warm the house okay. I think we’ll do alright through the winter. I hope we do. Mr. Hight has days where he is good and speaks clearly, has energy. He’ll take Joseph and cut firewood. We got a whole stockpile ready. And we’re making plans to patch the wall and roof.”

“Could at least get it covered with a tarp, something like.”

“That’s true. I wish we didn’t have to move here. It was the only place Mr. Ken still owned after his other place was lost to  foreclosure. We lost our place too. I just couldn’t make the bills with only my paycheck. Not with mouths to feed. Piggly Wiggly don’t pay cashiers those kind of wages.”

“Oh you work there, I like that old place. But I go to the Krogers most often now, since it opened up.”

He looked at Beth with a guilty expression.

“It is closer. I know how that is.”

Jacob nodded.

“So you live here with Mr. Hight and Joseph?”

“And Lizzie, my four year old. She’s a handful all by herself, let me tell you.”

“I bet. I know how that is.”

“How old are your kids?”

“Oh, I don’t have children. So far in life I am married to the church, as they say. Not that Southern Baptist Pastors can’t marry and have kids. We aren’t Catholic praise Jesus.”

“I see,” Beth giggled. She avoided continuing down that line of conversation and returned to the house, “So, we’re making it work, I guess. Doing the best with what we got.”

“Yes, ma’am. Jacob nodded. 

Beth tried not to make eye contact with him, her eyes wet. She rubbed them and then laughed again unexpectedly.

“I think we might have eavesdroppers.”

Jacob looked to where Beth was pointing and saw Joseph and a little girl staring out of a small window on the corner of the house. The girl waved. Joseph only watched.

“Is that Lizzie then?”

“That’s my little monster.”

“She’s a cutie.”

“Thank you.”

Beth waved back at them and then turned to the fence and a large field that went back for acres. She gestured to it and Jacob followed with his eyes.

“All of this was Hight Farm. And more. Hundreds of acres. If Mr. Ken hadn’t sold off this property there’s not telling how much it’d be worth nowadays the way the prices are shooting up. Now all that’s left is from here to that fence and then in front down to the trailer park. A good piece of land I suppose, but a lot of work to be done to get it back in shape.”

“That it is.”

Next to the roots was a small marker stone, faded and covered with dry dirt, grass high obscuring the words.

“Who is buried here?”

“That is Mr. Hight’s first wife. Ms. Carol. She died from breast cancer in nineteen sixty three. I always remember the year cause that’s when I was born. I’m sure it says on the marker there but its covered up with grass.”

Beth and Jacob continued around the house, stopping at a stone bird feeder filled with leaves. Admiring it, Jacob briefly caught a glimpse into the big window on that side, perhaps the den area where he saw an old man in a robe sitting on a recliner. The man was not doing anything. Not reading. Not watching television. Not even thinking the way it looked. Just staring into empty space. His gray hair was disheveled, his whiskers long and skin papery pale. Alone in the dim room.

When they came around again to the front Jacob did not walk onto the porch. He started towards the drive where a beat-up old jalopy sat uneven, one of the tires low. Olive green in color.

“Ms. Hight,” Jacob turned to her, “thank you for taking the time to talk with me today and for showing me your house. I don’t want to take up any more of your time.”

“Oh, its no bother. I like the company. And please call me Beth. I don’t deserve that formality.”

He smiled.

“Even so, ma’am. I mean Beth. Please tell Joseph to be at my place at eight am. Just behind the church there. I’m gonna go see about those other boys too, before it gets too dark.”

Beth nodded. Jacob did not quite know how to end the conversation gracefully, so he glanced over to the car and decided to make small talk about it.

“Chevy Vega. I haven’t seen one of these in years. Run good?”

“Don’t run at all, at the moment. You don’t know anything about cars do you? That’s my only transportation. Gave out a week ago. Been hitching rides to work since then.”

“I know a little bit,” Jacob admitted sheepishly, “Mind if I pop the hood?”

He opened the door and reached in to unlatch the hood, then walked over and propped it open. He leaned inside and did some quick diagnostic work, checked the fluids, belts, hoses.

“Mr. Ken looked and thought it might be the water pump. Whatever he thought was expensive, a few hundred dollars to fix and we don’t have that kind of money.”

“Yeah, water pump’ll run you. Might get a good deal at a junk yard though. Hard to tell right off. Does it run at all?”

“It starts but don’t run well, kind of sputters then dies. Overheats too. Crank it up if you want to. Keys should be in it.”

He got in and turned it over. It did start after a few attempts but the engine sounded weak, sick and once Jacob took his foot off the gas it died out. He tried a few more times with the same result.

“Hard to say what it is,” Jacob admitted, “But I tell you what Ms. Beth, I think I might be able to get it down to my place - got a work shelter there I can park it under, and my tools. I’d be happy to see what I can do.”

Beth lit up.

“You don’t have to do that, really.”

“Ma’am, I want to do it.”

“Well, thank you very much,” Beth said. She did not know what to say to that, “I can pay you something for your time.”

The pastor shook his head sternly and said with the utmost sincerity, “The opportunity to help another living soul is a gift from God above. I won’t accept your money, no ma’am.”

With some help from Joseph, who sat inside the car and pumped the gas and turned the ignition when Jacob gave the signal, they finally got the car started and in gear and eased it down the dirt driveway. The engine sputtered and jerked even taking it easy like he was, sounding like it might die at any moment. By the time it reached the trailer park it had sputtered out again.  Some neighbors poked their head out of small windows, watching him. Jacob popped the hood again and tinkered around and it started again. This happened twice more before he was on the road down to his place.

“What a decent man,” smiled Beth, who stood with arms crossed on the porch, Joseph and Lizzie beside her, watching him, “An uncommonly decent man, Jacob Brumbalow.”

Beth reached out to squeeze her son around the shoulder but he shirked away and opened the screen door, going inside without a word. Lizzie took his place beside their mother and their hands intertwined. Both watched as the pastor drove their car until it  disappeared beyond the row of trees that lined the drive to Oakwood Estates, then they too went inside.


Chapter Three


A morning wind blew through the tree tops and shook what few leaves remained in the oaks that enshrined Pastor Jacob’s farm house. The leaves fell in lazy arcs from those high places and landed next to the woodshed where Jacob and Joseph were standing. There were rakes and shovels, shears propped up against the shed. Every few seconds the pastor came out with another tool and handed it to Joseph whose job it was to arrange them outside. The last thing Jacob brought out was a bag of feed. He handed the burlap sack to Joseph, walked out of the shed, and closed the door.

Behind the Pastor Joseph followed until they reached the crude pen where all the chickens were. There was a mesh wire to keep them in and a small wooden shelter for them all to nest in at night, filled with straw. Jacob stepped over the fence and Joseph did the same. The chickens came swarming around, expectant, eager.

“My little angels,” the pastor said, “enjoy your breakfast.”

He took the bag of feed from Joseph and tossed handfuls of the corn feed. The chickens scattered at each toss in a panicked dash for the morsels. There were birds of every color. Brown, white, black. One had a limp, withered leg and Jacob tossed a handful specifically in close range to it.

“Suppose I could just get a feeder,” Jacob admitted to Joseph, “but I like to do it myself. It does a heart good to serve the small creatures of this world. Even them.”

Jacob’s gaze went to the horizon where the mountains were. He handed the bag to Joseph and asked him to spread a few more handfuls around, which he did.

“Do you think I speak strangely?” Jacob asked, “I know I do. Folks don’t normally talk like me. I’ve known that for a long time. I get a lot of strange looks from strangers. They think I carry a soapbox around with me.”

“I like the way you talk.”

Their eyes met and they smiled without saying anything else until the chickens were fed. After, they walked back to the shed and Jacob put up the feed and grabbed a handful of the tools. Joseph did the same and they walked up to the church, where by now the other boys were waiting for them.

“Well now, Jesse, Maurice, Ignacio, glad you could join us on this fine morning.”

The Oakwood Estate boys had been lounging on a stack of spare tires next to the garage. They rose when Jacob and Joseph appeared. None looked happy to be there.

“So what do you want us to do?”

“Now that doesn’t sound too enthusiastic, Jesse. We got a lot of work to do for Cornucopia. Mainly with the church. There’s kiosks and tents to set up, hay bales to arrange for the games and sitting areas, tables for the food vendors. And a few other things that escape me at the moment. We got a few days to take care of it all, but I want to get as much done as possible.”

Jesse and Maurice shuffled reluctantly towards the church. Ignacio was still half asleep, but when he saw Jacob and Joseph head that way he jumped to it and followed close behind. When they reached the church there was a red long-bed pickup truck loaded with bales of hay.

“Want you boys to start there. All them bales need to come down off that truck first thing. Then we need to arrange them according to Ms. Margaret’s diagram. I’ll go get that.”

Maurice heaved himself onto the truck bed and stood on a bale.

“Now wait a minute,” Jacob said, “Before we start the work today, I want you boys to reflect a minute on why you’re here the next few days.”

“Yes sir.”

“Jesse,” Jacob said, singling him out, “Why are you here today?”

“Cause that dog, I guess.”

“What about that dog, I guess?”

“Cause we was giving it a hard time I guess. Hell, I don’t know.”

The boys snickered. Jacob grew angry.

“Son, that ain’t a word we use around here. You watch that mouth or I’ll watch it for you, hear?”

“Sir.”

“Now what about that dog? Ignacio, what you got to say for yourself?”

“We treated that dog unkindly. That is not how we should treat animals who are our kin under God.”

“Amen to that. Thank you, Ignacio.”

Jacob pointed to the recreation area where there was a basketball goal and some tables set up.

“Set you boys up with some water over there on the table. And since its cold out, I had Ms. Margaret whip you up some cocoa. You just tell her when you’re ready for a cup. And that’s after you’ve unloaded this truck first. Got to get this thing back to Jeremy before the end of the day.”

They all stood around.

“Well, what you waiting for? Christmas? Hop to it.”

The boys started heaving bales of hay one after the other. Maurice and Ignacio were on the truck, while Jesse and Joseph caught them from below and started stacking them on the ground.

“Hold up, Joseph. I have another job for you, son. Follow me please.”

The other boys exchanged significant glances and from the corner of their eyes glared at Joseph, whom they felt was getting special treatment. Joseph felt their malice and rushed to catch up with Jacob who was headed back to his house.

Around the back of Jacob’s house there was a fenced in vegetable and flower garden. There were stone decorations, gnomes and bird feeders. The vegetation dried up from the season. All in all it was a nice garden.

“Pastor before grew this garden, set up all these statues and stuff. Thing is, I don’t have no use for it myself. And it just looks awful with no upkeep. My thumbs are missing the green if you know what I mean?”

Joseph had never heard the expression before so he just nodded.

“Anyway, I want you to work on tearing this thing out of here. By the time you’re through the whole twenty square foot area should be one big patch of dirt. Think you can handle that?”

“Where should I put the decorations?”

“Over there on the junk pile. I’ll break em up with the sledgehammer later, unless I can talk you into doing that too.”

“Can I?”

Jacob grinned.

“I thought you might be into something like that. I set that sledge over by the shed. Just put it back when you’re done.”

“Where should I put all the plants and vegetable stalks, weeds.”

“Anything you tear out of the ground just put over there in the burn pile. I’m gonna rake some leaves this afternoon once I get through fixing your mom’s car. I’ll burn everything this evening in the bonfire. We’ll have some hot dogs ready at lunchtime too.”

“Okay.”

“Be sure and take a break every now and then.”

“Yes, sir.”

Once Jacob was gone Joseph took a moment to survey the work to be done. Across the yard he saw the other boys working and cutting up. A part of him wanted to join in with them. He wasn’t sure why Jacob had given him to this job, but he was determined to do it well. So he set to work.

He figured the best way to approach it would be to first empty the garden of all the decorations and stone statues. So he picked the largest one, an obnoxious looking stone garden gnome, and hefted up on one shoulder and took it to the junk pile over by the garage. After that he grabbed them all, one by one, the bird feeder, the cherubs, the boy sitting on a bench. Then he grabbed the stained glass flowers, red, purple, orange. There was a faded nylon kite of a butterfly and he took that too. All in all it took a good forty five minutes to get everything non-green onto the junk pile.

Sweating and dirty he stopped for a quick break. Thought about grabbing a cold cup of water but didn’t feel like encountering the other boys at the moment. 

It felt good to work this way. To use his body and strength to some good purpose. Like how it ought to be.

He walked to the shed to grab the sledge hammer, a ten pounder that was well worn. He grasped the polished wooden handle with both arms and heaved the metal head over his shoulders and brought it down with all his force onto the garden gnome. It shattered into a dozen pieces of various sizes. Joseph felt the thrill of it. He continued to smash everything that was smash able and by the end of it there lay a patch of rubble at his feet.

Now it was time to start clearing the green things. Again he decided to start with the largest and work his way down. That seemed the most logical way to do it. Jacob had set a pair of work gloves out with the rest of the tools that day and he donned them now to make his work easier. Already he had a few blisters from the sledge.

He began by pulling up all the plants and small trees which lined the garden. At first it was easy to grab ahold at the base and lift with his back. But fatigue set in quick and it became harder and harder. He kept going though and soon the area around the fence was all cleared away, the remains lay in a pile nearby. 

Joseph took another break. He saw there was nobody at the table with the water cooler. Those other boys he heard on the other side of the church. They must be laying out those hay bales. Quickly he went over to it and filled the paper cup set out for them. He drank the water down and felt his energy return. Then he drank another three cups before his thirst was quenched.

He grabbed the long machete that lay next to the sledge hammer by the shed and commenced to attack the high weeds and tomato plant vines. He swung the blade like some primitive being. Fun was not the right word to describe it, but it was close. More like ecstasy. A meditative destruction. There was a rhythm to it and once he was in tune with it the time passed like water.

Before he knew it the garden was clear, at least from a few inches up. There was still the knee-work of pulling roots. He stopped with the machete and carried all the brush and weeds over to the burn pile, which was already large, stacked with busted wooden furniture, piles of leaves, shredded office documents. There was even an old doll in there burned up.

For the last bit of work he got down on his knees and set to pulling up the small rooted vegetable stalks, weeds sprouted from neglect. As he pulled the dark earth tilled and he could smell the life in the dirt, the decayed organics, fertile. 

It took awhile to pull the roots. There were some rocks set purposefully in places and he lifted them up to expose the worms and bugs. He brushed them off the rock and heaved them over the fence. A game he played was to see how close he could get one rock to the previous.

By this point he was famished and cold, his back aching. He thought it might be close to lunch time but had no way to tell the time. Not much left to do here. Once the roots were pulled the area could use a good raking and it would be just as Jacob had asked him. Lost in this idea he sat back on his feet and looked towards the garage. His mother’s Vega was there, up on two hydraulic jacks. He saw the pastor’s legs poking out. He then thought of his mother and Jacob walking together from the day before. His blood boiled at the thought. Why he asked. Why did they walk together?

A large flat stone at the far corner of the garden was the hardest one to lift. He hovered it and lift up from the bottom with both hands. As it flopped over he discovered underneath a nest of black widows and fell backwards on his hands to get away. They scattered to the darkest region, a shadowed area underneath the stone. A large one whose bulbous abdomen was as large as a penny, and maybe a dozen tiny ones. Joseph cautiously approached and studied them in horror.

He grabbed a stick and prodded at the edge of their hiding place. The large one reared up and waved its two front legs. The smaller ones kept in packs behind the large one. He thought about going to fetch Jacob but didn’t. He imagined them stirring in the darkness and the damp soil. A wave of revolt went through  him, disgusted by their ugliness. He wanted to get as far away as he could. He wanted to destroy them.

But instead he rose to his feet and from the shed he found a large snow shovel, with a wide scoop. He carried it over to the family of spiders and dug in underneath them. Carefully he pulled up a deep clod of the earth. The spiders were nearly undisturbed. He walked the shovel over behind the shed and dumped it with a quick downward shake. Then he returned to the garden. 

When Joseph was sure there were no more he flipped the flat stone onto its side and rolled it outside the fence area. When he got back checked his feet to make sure no stray spider had made it up his leg.

Afterwards he made his way over to the recreation area where Ms. Margaret had set out a few paper plates with some hot dogs under tin foil, then another plate with chopped onions, and two bottles of mustard and ketchup. A bag of Lays too.

Joseph bit into a hot dog and realized how wore out he really was. He could literally feel the energy return to his shoulders and arms. He scarfed down the rest in two more bites and made another. Then he sat down against the side of the brick building and rested. He took his time with the second dog, savoring its salty greasiness that contrasted nicely with a sprinkle of chopped onions and a dollop of mustard.

As he finished the other boys wandered up and helped themselves to the lunch. They were covered in sweat and grime. Bits of hay clung to their clothes, and bands of sweat soaked through their shirts at the collar and pits. They did not look happy to be there.

Joseph watched them, wanting to make conversation, but not sure where to start. Instead he went over and sat against the brick wall of the building. He bowed his head against his knees and closed his eyes, resting.

Jesse, Maurice, and Ignacio joked with one another and chatted about the usual things. Cars they would like to have one day, the store where the Indian owner would sell cigarettes to minors, girls who were easy. Joseph was comfortable when they talked about those things because the attention was not on him and he preferred it that way. But then a lull came.

Something pinged against his left leg. Then another. He lifted his eyes and saw pieces of onions on the ground. Then another hit him in the forehead. He looked up and glared. Maurice was close to him with a handful.

“Stop that.”

“Just making sure you ain’t asleep,” Maurice said. His laughter turned to anger, “some of us got to work today.”

“Some of us working our ass off while others get to kick back and relax,” Jesse added.

“I been working. I been working all morning. Look at my hands.”

“What you been doing?”

“Tearing out the garden at Jacob’s farm.”

“Bullshit,” Jesse said, “Show me.”

Jesse rose from the table and walked towards Joseph.

“I don’t got to show you nothing.” 

Joseph spit his words.

“You don’t want to show cause you ain’t been doing nothing.”

Jesse walked closer and did not stop until he was right at his feet. He then kicked them hard and mashed his toe into the concrete. Joseph squirmed free and rose He stared square at Jesse.

“Why don’t you cut it out, Jesse?”

“What you gonna do about it? Bastard boy.”

Joseph flinched at the insult even though he tried to not show it. His eyes watered at the corners.

“That’s what Pastor Jacob told us. Said your daddy was sorry. Left yall. And now he ain’t never coming back. What he said.”

“Fuck you. You fucking liar.”

“Ain’t that what he said?” Jesse turned to his friends.

“He said you daddy left and no come back no more.” 

Ignacio made like he was crying and wiped his eyes, and the others laughed.

“Now you’re just a bastard,” Jesse repeated, and with emphasis, “Boy.”

He then shoved Joseph in the chest with both hands at full force and the smaller one fell back against the brick wall and banged his head. He saw black then white and felt a cold sting on the back side of his head.

“Come on you fuckin bastard! You come at me and I’ll kick your sorry ass up and down the churchyard.”

Jesse was red in the face. His eyes fierce. Joseph had a very serious look on his face, but it was not anger. Jesse raised his hands in front of his face like a boxer, his fists clenched and bowed up. Joseph heard him muttered “bastard boy” under his breath, over and over again.

“Quit saying that.”

“Fucking bastard boy. I hate your goddamn guts. You just a little pussy and I can’t stand pussies.”

There was a brief moment as Joseph swung that he seemed to be watching himself from the outside, disconnected from the trouble, just observing, but the pain of that first contact with Jesse’s jaw brought him back to his body. And then he swung again. And again.

Jesse shielded himself from each subsequent blow, only the first one really connecting, but it did burst his lip and there were now a few droplets of blood on the basketball court at their feet.

Maurice and Ignacio circled around them and watched but the two others were oblivious, each boy locked into his rage. 

Jesse was taller and stronger so when he took his first swing it connected hard against Joseph’s jaw. He felt a piercing jolt and a tooth inside came loose in his mouth. He fell back on one hand and covered his face with the other. Jesse fell down on top of him. They rolled over and over, each boy fighting to be the one on top. Joseph grabbed the back of Jesse’s jacket and tried to pull it off and the arm tore in a single loud rip. Each one uttered obscenity after obscenity at the other.

Joseph had never felt so much hatred for anything in his life. If he had had the strength he would have killed Jesse Black for sure. Jesse connected one time in Joseph’s right eye and grazed his forehead. A red rash immediately appeared and his eye closed in pain.

They ended up on the ground. Their feet thrashed for traction and slung mud everywhere. Their jeans were covered in grass stains and mud. At that point Joseph turned the wrong way and Jesse caught a hold of him from behind, with one arm pulled against his back. He immediately stopped the struggle and collapsed in pain. Jesse knew he could break the arm with this leverage. He inched the arm up his back and felt Joseph shrivel each time.

“My arm. Let go of my fucking arm,” Joseph pleaded.

“Tell me you’re a bastard boy!”

“I ain’t saying that.”

Jesse inched up his arm a bit more and Joseph screamed.

“Say it now!”

Again he pushed the arm. This time the agony was too much for Joseph to bear.

“Bastard boy. Bastard boy.”

“Who’s a bastard boy?”

“Me,” Joseph submitted, “Now let me go. I’m the bastard boy. Me.”

Jesse released him with a final angry shove. Joseph caught himself and looked to make sure Jesse wasn’t going to attack again. But when Jesse looked at his jacket and jeans, Joseph was overcome with the dark anger. He saw his vision darken and charged at unsuspecting Jesse and tackled him into the mud. This time Jesse used his strength to roll over on top of Joseph and got one knee against his throat. Joseph flailed his arms helplessly while Jesse beat his head into the ground. Joseph tried to breathe in but couldn’t draw in enough air. He gasped and tried to push Jesse off but Jesse was too heavy and much too strong.

A hand from above grabbed Jesse by the collar of his jacket and swung him roughly to one side. Then he got between them both, his arms stretched in both directions. Each boy watched the other through the pastor, though neither would attempt to restart the fight now. Slowly their heart rates returned to normal and they felt around for the wounds on their faces and arms.

Joseph looked at Jacob and saw tears in reddened eyes. He felt a deep shame like he was sinking into a bottomless pit of mud. He wanted to escape into its darkness and stay there forever. Jacob said nothing to any of them except for once when he whispered, “Why don’t they understand?” to no one specific.

After some time Jacob told Maurice and Ignacio to return to the front of the church to finish up laying out the hay bales and start helping with the apples. Then he took Jesse inside to have Ms. Margaret tend to the cuts on his face and lip. When he emerged out carried a first aid kit and a bottle of Bactine.

Jacob then knelt in front of Will and dressed the cuts on his neck and forehead. There were other bruises on his face and arms but there was nothing to be done about those. Joseph accepted the pain of the antiseptic as punishment and wanted very badly for Jacob to look at him or say something to him, but he never did. When he finished he turned immediately to head back inside, but turned half around and spoke at him, but not to him.

“Go ahead and clean up the garden area, what you finished. Rake up them leaves and loose dirt, put it in the pile. After that head on back home for the day.”

Then he walked inside.

Joseph shuffled back to the garden and mechanically went to work. But there was no joy in it like there was before. He started crying and hid behind the wall in case anyone walked by and saw him. All the bottled up emotions poured out of him. He sobbed into his hands like he had not done since he was a baby. There was a darkness in his heart, the bottomless pit of mud. Every time he moved he felt a guilt sucking the energy from his limbs.

When the garden was raked and cleaned he put up all the tools and carried the remaining weeds and twigs over to the burn pile. Standing at the edge was Pastor Jacob. He had lit the pile with a gallon of gasoline and it was just now lighting up. In the fading light of the afternoon it was beautiful to see.

Joseph went over and threw the rest of the weeds into the pile. They immediately smoked and caught aflame. The smaller ones curled up into ashen embers almost right away.

He went and stood beside the Pastor Jacob who still had not spoken to him. They both watched the fire burn in silence. Its flames whipped against the cold wind. Heat radiated outward and warmed their faces and bathed them in an amber glow.

“I feel like a failure,” Jacob said at last. It was completely unlike what Joseph had been expecting, so much so that he didn’t know what to say.

“It was me who failed,” Joseph said.

In silence they continued to watch the fire burn. The fire grew so large they had to stand back and Joseph felt he heat on his face and simultaneously the cold of the evening on his back.

It was that time of day when the shapes of things become indistinct and fade into shadows or even disappear. Joseph stared into the fire one moment and the next he was on the road to his house. He wasn’t sure Jacob even saw him go. Before leaving the yard he looked back and saw the pastor’s silhouette against the leaping flames, silent and rigid.

Joseph zipped up and thrust his hands in his coat pockets but the cold quickly penetrated his jacket’s thin material. He was shivering. There was a wind that blew through the limbs in the trees above. Against his face it was like a sting. He hurried up the road halfway between a walk and a jog. When he came to the entryway to Oakwood Estates he looked inside all the trailers to the warmth within. Now up the hill he could see the farm house and the lights from the living room window a beacon to him in the darkness.

As he came to the front porch his gait slowed and instead of going straight in he went over to the living room window and peered in. There was his mother and Lizzie reading Curious George out loud on the couch. Grandpa was there too, on the recliner listening. None of them saw him, so he continued to watch. Mother turned the page and Lizzie grew excited and shouted something and raised her arms like a monkey and grandpa erupted into a spontaneous fit of laughter.

In that moment Joseph felt far away from them. It was like five hundred years had passed since this morning; it was like he had walked around the Earth for seven years. He didn’t fully grasp what he was feeling at that moment but he had understood something for the first time in his life. Tears welled in his eyes. He understood that a moment in time was not something he could ever possess, and yet he felt a strong desire to possess this moment — to keep it with him always. He took his hands out of his coat pocket and pressed one of his palms against the cold window. That caught Lizzie’s attention and she jumped from her mother’s lap and raced over to place her hand over his, laughing. Only a pane of glass was between them.


Chapter Four


They were late so Beth handed Joseph the keys to the car and asked him to go warm it up.

“How do I do it?”

“You put the key in the switch, crank it up, and let it run.”

“Do I press any pedals?”

“Do not press any pedals.”

“Okay.”

“Or touch the steering wheel. Just key, switch, turn.”

“Yes ma’am.”

“And turn the heater on.”

Joseph already had on his good clothes and ran out the door. He had never been entrusted to start the car before. The seats were icy cold, the vinyl hard. He carefully put the key his mother handed him (not any of the others) into the switch and turned it. The engine turned over then died. He remembered his mother usually pumped the gas a few times but was forbidden to do that, so he tried again this time holding the ignition so it kept turning over. After a few sections the engine rumbled and went into idle. He turned on the heater and went back inside to wait on everybody.

Beth asked Grandpa Ken if he’d like to go to the Cornucopia Festival one more time, and getting the expected answer of no, round up Lizzie and her doll, picked up her purse and an apple pie she made, and they all headed out the door.

The car pulled down the drive and made it just past the entrance to Oakwood Estates when it started to rattle like something was loose in the engine compartment and then shut off completely. It rolled to a stop and Beth tried to force the wheel over but it wouldn’t budge.

Lizzie looked around confused. Beth tried to restart the ignition but it didn’t even try to turn over. Joseph watched his mother.

“Why did we stop?”

“Quiet, Lizzie,” Joseph said.

“Baby, hold on a minute.”

After it was clear the car was not going to start, Beth considered their options. She looked up the hill, then down the road. Either way it was a good walk, especially in this weather. After the sun went down the temperature dropped below freezing. Single digits coming sometime in the night. They had signs at the trailer park that told people to leave their faucets dripping.

Beth zipped up her coat and made sure Lizzie had on her coat. She did. But her mittens they had left in the rush.

“Do you have your gloves?”

“No ma’am.”

Beth was upset but she tried not to show it.

“Do you want to run back up to the house and fetch your gloves and Lizzie’s mittens?”

Joseph nodded and started to get out.

“No, nevermind. Don’t do that.”

Joseph stopped, awaiting direction.

“Let’s just try to get this car off the road a bit. It’s kind of in a dangerous spot. A car not paying attention could run into it.”

“Okay.”

“Look here. Climb out and get in the back. When I yell start pushin. I’m going to put it in neutral and steer.”

“Yes ma’am.”

“Push hard.”

“Alright.”

Joseph got out and went behind the car. The metal body was so cold he could feel his hands try to stick to it. Beth put the car in neutral and shouted for Joseph to push. Joseph dug his feet into the dirt road and heaved his entire weight against the trunk, but he only succeeded in rocking against the wore-out shocks. It bounced a few times but didn’t budge.

“Ain’t going no where.”

“I can see that.”

“What should we do now?”

Beth got out of the car and walked back to where Joseph stood.

“Here, why don’t you get in and steer us onto the side of the road, this way.”

She made a gesture like turning the wheel to the right ever so slightly. Joseph nodded and got in. He put both hands on the wheel to guide it. He saw his mother in the side mirror lean into the trunk with all her strength. Puffs of her breath floated into the night air as she groaned. It started to move.

“It’s going, mama!”

“I see that baby,” Beth said, her voice straining, “now steer us to the side of the road.”

“Okay.”

The car gained momentum and it wasn’t long before they were on the grass. But there was a frozen mud puddle and just as they got to a good place Beth slipped on it and fell on her knees. The bottom of the dress was soaked. She rose and cursed, then walked angrily to the driver’s door.

“Scootch over.”

Joseph slid into the passenger seat. Beth got in and put the car in park, turned on the emergency lights. She turned on the dome light and looked at her dress.

“Knew I shouldn’t have worn this thing. Now look at it.”

“Ain’t your fault, mama,” Joseph said.

“Well,” Beth sighed, “do you guys want to try to go to the fall festival, or go back to the house?”

“Festival!” Lizzie shouted.

Joseph wanted to go to the festival, but he knew his mother probably didn’t now. He kept quiet.

“Let’s go then,” Beth said.

It was about three quarters of a mile to New Calvary from where the Vega broke down. Beth took Lizzie out of her car seat and set her down. Joseph zipped up his coat and put his hands in his pocket. They started walking.

The sky was clear and the stars were out, shining brightly. Lizzie gazed up at them as they walked together. Then she got tired and asked for her mother to hold her, so Beth picked her up and continued. Joseph walked along the edge of the woods and breathed in rhythms that he thought sounded like a train.

In the distance they could see car lights in the church parking lot and more lights beyond the tree line of colors orange, yellow, and green. There was some kind of music playing but they were too far to place it.

“I sure hope they have apple cider,” Joseph said.

“Hot apple cider,” Beth added.

“I’ll have a gallon.”

They laughed and quickened their pace. 

By now they were starting to see people. Families walking together in the light. A tractor was pulling up with a load of kids in the back. The hay ride.

“Can we do the hay ride mama?” Joseph asked.

“If you want, baby.”

“Mama, I don’t want to do the hay ride.” Lizzie said.

“Me neither hon. We’ll leave that to the boys, what do you say?”

“It’s too cold out here!”

“That’s right.”

As they came up to the end of the road they saw a large paper banner that had been strung across two trees at the turn. It said, “Welcome to the Cornucopia”. They passed under it as they headed towards the main entrance of the big building. There must have been a hundred or so people there from the looks of it, both congregation and those just out for the entertainment.

They didn’t know anyone at New Calvary, but the people seemed friendly, walking around together with red faces in their puffy jackets and coats, carrying cups of steaming coffee and cider.

The music they had heard from the road was a live bluegrass band playing on a small stage set up in the basketball court area. On the stage was a large cornucopia made of straw and filled with flowers and dried ears of corn. The bands was playing a song that Joseph liked, something you might call foot-stomping. A few couples danced in front of the band. One of the banjo players took a break and blew into his hands for warmth. 

The family went inside and were greeting by two elderly women in matching sweaters with black cats on them. Good food lined the buffet table. Traditional southern fare. They were told to help themselves. Joseph dished himself a slab of ham, mac and cheese, turnip greens and two dinner rolls with butter. To go with that he poured a cup of steaming apple cider. They sat at one of the empty plastic tables that had been set up in the open space.

Everyone who passed by smiled at them. Lizzie waved at total strangers and tried to talk to the little kids who walked by, but they were too afraid to talk back. It was warm inside. There was a tall fireplace at the far corner burning bright. A stack of fuel logs were piled up in a stand next to it.

“This food is delicious!” Beth said. She made eye contact with the of the women at the door and indicated she approved of the food. The ladies nodded and smiled.

“Mama, I want to look at the horsies.”

“We’ll go out there in a minute, hon. Let mama finish her food.”

A young couple then approached their table. They were attractive, dressed a little nicer than everyone else, and acted somewhat ashamed of their boldness. The woman spoke first.

“Sorry to bother y’all. By any chance are you Beth Hight and family?”

Beth held out her hand. She shook hands with the woman and then the man.

“Well, yes we are. I’m Beth and this is my son Joseph and my daughter Lizzie.”

Lizzie waved to them and Joseph nodded. The woman and man both beamed and exchanged glances.

“Pastor Jacob told us all about y’all. Said y’all might be coming tonight. We just wanted to stop by and introduce ourselves. My name is Kelly and this is my husband Steven. We’re the Echols. Steven is the youth pastor here at New Calvary and I work in the office part time. We live just down the road.”

“Well, that’s awfully nice of you to come by. I didn’t know Jacob was going to make a fuss. He just invited us the other day you know.”

“Oh its no fuss. We’re just like that around here. Gossip spreads like wild fire. Jacob can’t stop talking about meeting you and Joseph and your house on the hill.”

She laughed in a charming way and pushed the hair off her shoulders. Steven leaned in close to Lizzie and spoke to her in a small voice.

“Ms. Lizzie, have you ever tried bowling with a pumpkin?”

“Bowling with a pumpkin?”

“That’s right. And if you knock down all the pins you can win a prize!”

Lizzie turned to her mother.

“I know darlin, we can go pumpkin bowling. Hold on just a minute.”

“Oh, no, what did you do Steven?”

“I just couldn’t help myself.”

Everyone laughed. Joseph and Beth got up. Beth handed Joseph the plates to throw away which he did in the nearest container. Beth wiped the crumbs from her lap drawing attention to her stained dress. Kelly gasped.

“Oh my dear Lord, what happened to your dress?”

“Our car broken down on the drive over. It was dark and I slipped in a mud puddle. Not a big deal.”

“Well we need to treat it while its still fresh. Let’s go to the wash room.”

Beth looked confused but Kelly place her hand on her shoulder to assure her.

“It’s no trouble at all, darlin. Won’t take but a minute. Just follow me.”

Joseph took Lizzie’s hand and they all went together through a hallway to the back of the building. The lights were off but she switched them on as they walked through the rooms. They came to a small laundry area, which surprised Beth to see in a church building, but she didn’t say anything.

“The only reason I insist is I had a dress that stained in the mud last year and I like to never forgave myself for not treating it right off. That thing never looked the same again.”

“You’re probably right.”

Kelly looked in the cabinets over the washing machine and pulled out a green bottle of Clorox treatment solution. She knelt at Beth’s feet and took a scrub brush that lay on the ground and lightly patted the area while spritzing with the treatment. Joseph and Lizzie wandered in place, looking at the office equipment.

“Y’all stay close. Don’t touch anything, you hear me?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

After a minute of treatment the stain was noticeably less intense. Kelly rose. She looked proud of herself.

“There are you, ma’am. I think that’ll do it. Next time you put that thing in the wash the rest of the stain is gonna come right out.”

“You are an angel,” Beth said, “thank you so much.”

“I just consider it atonement for my own dress.”

“Okay,” Steven said, “I’ve think we’ve had enough boring old housekeeping. Let’s go have some fun.”

“Yeah!” Lizzie and Joseph both agreed.

In the front of the building, facing the main road were several games set up. There was ring toss where you tried to loop a metal ring over some set up milk bottles, guess the number of dry pinto beans in a glass jug, and over on the end pumpkin bowling, where you got to pick your pumpkin and try to knock over five bowling pins. The alley was formed from bales of hay.

Steven picked up a tiny pumpkin and handed it to Lizzie. She admired it and carefully stepped up to the alley. With both hands she threw the pumpkin overhead and it went over the hay bales into the ring toss area, knocking over some milk jugs.

Steven and Joseph started laughing. Beth gasped and put her hand over her mouth. Kelly shouted, “Oh, no!” The boy tending the game gave an annoyed glare and tossed the pumpkin back to Steven.

“Thanks, Kenneth. Sorry about that.”

“Did I win it?” Lizzie asked.

“No,” Steven said, “I’m afraid not yet. Do you want to try again?”

“I want Joseph to do it now. It’s his turn.”

Joseph took a turn and being a game designed for kids he easily knocked over the pins. Still, everyone cheered for him. The girl tending the game handed Joseph a small pumpkin with a smiley face painted on it as a prize. He handed it to Lizzie who was ecstatic to receive it.

“Oh,” Kelly said, turning to them as if she had just remembered something, “you have to try Ms. Margaret’s ginger bread. You never had anything like it in your life. Come on.”

Each one of them got a small slice of the gingerbread on a paper plate and a Dixie up of hot cider to go with it. The cake was moist and spicy, kept warm in the heating tray. They all agreed it was much better than they expected it to be. Kelly looked proud.

“I wouldn’t lie to y’all, was that not the best thing you ever tasted?”

“It was really good.” Joseph agreed.

While drinking the cider and having a couple more pieces of the gingerbread they talked about the church and Pastor Jacob, and Steven was in the middle of a story about the time Jacob tried to bake an apple pie for a fundraiser when a hand clasped onto his shoulder from behind.

“What’s that now, Steven? My ears were burning over there so I had to come over.”

Steven turned red. Everyone else laughed.

“Now brother Jacob, you know I wouldn’t talk bad about your cooking.”

“I suppose not. That apple pie was the best door stopper we ever had around here. Ain’t that right, sweet pea?”

Jacob leaned over and poked Lizzie in the belly, who laughed even though she didn’t get the joke. He rose and greeted Joseph with a hand extended.

“Nice of you to make it, Mr. Hight.”

Joseph smiled big and shook his hand.

“Yes, sir.”

He then turned to Beth and gave her a hug.

“Miss Beth, so happy you could make it to our little festival. Have you had any of Miss Margaret’s gingerbread yet?”

“Oh yes, Kelly brought us over here.”

They stood around and talked and then the band got back on stage after taking a short break. The erupted into a lively song that got a few young couples out on the dance area. Steven extended his arm to Kelly and she winked and they took off to the floor and joined the others. They were very good dancers. Then Jacob extended his arm to Beth who looked taken aback. She even blushed a little but smiled. She took his arm and they hopped off to the dance floor. When Steve and Kelly saw them they clapped and made a space for them to join in.

Joseph and Beth watched from the games area, hand in hand. Jacob led her in the dance and was graceful on his feet as well. He spun their mother and dipped her at one point. Beth laughed. It had been a long time since he saw his mother so happy. He was happy too.

When the song was over they returned to where Joseph and Lizzie were and rested. The band started playing another song but they all agreed one song was enough.

Jacob noticed the stain on Beth’s dress and remarked to her.

“Did we just do that out there?”

Beth blushed and seemed reluctant to tell him how it happened, but then Kelly broke in.

“Their dang car broke down on the way over here tonight, would you believe that? Luckily they don’t live far.”

Jacob’s expression darkened and his light-hearted mood faded. They all saw him turn and became concerned themselves.

“What’s wrong, pastor?” Steven asked.

“Mr. Jacob thankfully fixed my car problem the other day,” Beth said, “I think something else is wrong with it now.”

Jacob took off his hat, exposing his balding head, twisting the brim in both hands.

“Mr. Beth, I do apologize I was not able to repair your car properly.”

“It’s not your fault, Mr. Jacob. Really.”

“Well, now. I can’t help but think it is. You’re kind to say that but the truth is you entrusted me and I let you down. That weighs on me.”

“Don’t be so hard on yourself, Jacob,” Steven said, seeing how upset he was. He placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Well, I don’t know what to say except to repeat the words of Jesus Christ, if a man compels thee to go a mile, go with him twain.”

With that, Jacob left the group and walked towards the stage. The band was in between sets and was preparing to go into another song, but Jacob walked onto the stage under the bright light and whispered something to the leader of the band, who nodded and instructed the other members to put up their instruments. Then they departed from the stage leaving Jacob there alone. He still carried his hat in his hands which lent him a reverential air.

The people at the festival had seen him walk on stage and over a period of a minute had all but quieted to a whisper.

“Friends,” Jacob began, “I was inspired just now to come up here and speak to you all, concerning a matter very close to my heart these last few days.”

The pastor spoke quietly into the microphone. It created an intimate setting. Families moved closer to the stage in unison. Jacob paused between thoughts, staring at the stage floor. The lights from above shone down onto his crown and you could see the beads of sweat forming there.

“I met a family recently. The Hight family. Yes, that Hight family, whose farm land this all used to be. The Hights of the Hight Farm that sits abandoned up on the hill. Except, Hight Farm is not abandoned. Not anymore. I met the boy Joseph there and then had the fortune to meet his mother Beth and the little one Lizzie. Misfortune has brought them back to that old house on the hill. And the key word here is ‘old’ praise Jesus name.”

The crowd laughed. Beth, Joseph, and Lizzie stood there unsure what to do. Beth did not make eye contact with those eyes she felt looking at her family. She kept her eyes on the stage.

“I had a tour of their house the other day. It’s a miracle really. An old house from the depression era, probably built in the twenties or thereabouts. Wouldn’t you say so Beth?”

Beth nodded, shy.

“But time has not been kind to this house. This home. A large Water Oak has fallen on the roof creating a draft and other structural problems. The only heating in the place is the wood stove in the kitchen.”

Jacob walked over to a stack of hay bales that were on the stage and sat down upon one of them. He seemed to struggle to find the right words for what he wanted to say.

“Before I get on with it, I’d like to make a confession to you all here tonight. If you’ll let me.”

He looked up at that point as if asking for permission from the crowd.

“I said, if you let me I’ll confess to you here tonight, is that okay with everybody? Please say amen.”

“Amen, brother Jacob.”

“Amen, Pastor.”

A few people shouted. Others followed. Jacob seemed pleased. He continued.

“When I was a young man, living in Birmingham, boy I was full of verve and spit. Whatever it was young men were full of back in those days. Working as a mobile car doctor. I bet you all don’t even know what that is. Well, I’ll spare you the trouble to ask. It’s a mechanic that makes house calls. I went around all over the city fixing folks cars. Good money. Steady paycheck. And I had plans with that money. Had a girl. Noreen. We were to be married. But what I was most excited about was building a house. And not just any house. The house of my dreams. That I would build with my own two hands and where I would raise a family and live out the rest of my days on this Earth. I had blueprints drawn up. How many rooms. A large foyer. The wrap-around porch. I scouted parcels of land just outside the city limits. Found a perfect spot on five acres with a creek in the back. It was perfect in my mind. Everything perfect. Yes sir.”

He lifted his hands to his face and wiped away the sweat that trickled into his gleaming eyes. There was not a sound to be heard in the crowd. Adults and children alike were captivated by his speech. There was something in the tone of it that went beyond just the words that were spoken. A mesmerizing cadence he had that sucked you into the world of his story, no matter what it was.

“And I guess at this moment you might be asking yourself, why are you not living in that magnificent house right now, Pastor Jacob? Why are you living in the modest, but practical pastor in residence accommodations of the New Calvary Baptist Church, And you’d be right to ask yourself that.”

“I wish as your pastor I could tell you I had a vision from the Lord. I wish I could tell you it was my road to Damascus moment, where I cast off all worldly treasures and decided to dedicate my heart to Jesus.”

“Amen, pastor,” a lone voice shouted.

“Amen to you brother. But let me tell you. That was not it. Like I told you before I began telling it, this is a confessional, and I wanted to you all to hear it told. The simple reason I am not living in that magnificent house, raising my kids, growing old with my fiancé Noreen, is because I never built it in the first place. I never had kids. I never married Noreen.”

“You see, I knew as a young man. Boy I thought I was so clever back then. I could see the future. I could see it all. And I knew in my heart that the house I could build would never be as magnificent as it was in my mind, in my dreams of it. And I guess that goes for any children I would raise there, and for my wife too. Nothing could every be as perfect in the real world as in my dreams of it. And, sorry to say, that paralyzed me. And I never built that house. Noreen left years later when my fortune changed and had no more money to build a house and start a family anyway. I never built the house of my dreams. And that was a sin. A great sin. Not that the house wasn’t built. But that I let fear prevent me from manifesting a vision. The Lord speaks to us in so many ways, and he spoke to me and gave me that vision of the house and the family, but I was afraid. I lived in fear of the possibility it could never live up to what I imagined that I never even tried. And that was a sin. A great sin against God.”

Jacob rose and paced the stage. No one in the crowd spoke. It was quiet for a minute and felt like a shock when his voice range out again.

“So when I see the Hight family, returning to their family home, trying to restore it again to the glory of the past. My heart goes out to them, you know. My heart cries out for them to succeed, praise Jesus.”

“Amen.”

“My heart cries out and more than that I want to help. I want to help them to make it. To restore that old farm house. To fulfill their own dream, that dream that comes from God above. You believe it, yes sir!”

“Praise the Lord!”

“And I know you too want to help them, the flock of New Calvary. We can help this family in their time of need. Let’s raise the money they need to rebuild the farm. Let’s raise the money to fix their roof. Heat their home for the coming winter. It’s liable to be a mighty cold winter this year.”

Jacob walked to the large cornucopia and picked it up. He toss the flowers and fruit onto the ground and held it up for all to see.

“Let’s fill this horn with the good will of the Lord’s community. Let’s help the Hight family and know that help will come our way, should we ever need it. Praise Jesus for me one more time.”

“Praise Jesus!” many cried out.

Joseph reached into his pocket and dumped the contents of his wallet into the cornucopia horn, a wad of bills and some coins. Then he passed it over to the nearest crowd member. That person dropped in some money and passed it to the next, and around it went.

Joseph placed the microphone back in its stand and walked off stage to join the others. He was covered in sweat and seemed to be in a daze. He donned his hat and shook hands with some of the crowd. Then he came over to where Kelly, Steven and the Hight family stood and smiled at them, and had a look of surprise when Beth leapt into his arms and hugged him hard around the neck.


Chapter Five


Twenty three degrees this morning according to the rusty thermostat nailed by the front door. The coldest morning yet this year. Joseph tiptoed back into his room, avoiding certain noisy slats in the floor, and pulled his long johns from the bottom dresser drawer. As he struggled to pull them on his breath escaped in rapid puffs that rose to the ceiling. Frost covered the windows so that the sunlight came through muted and soft. He tried not to wake Lizzie as he layered on his thermals and then jeans and a sweatshirt on top of that.

Grandpa Ken did not rise this morning to light the stove. His door was shut, as was mother’s, but Joseph knew what must be done. He picked up the empty basket and went outside.

But when he reached the woodpile near the shed he could see there was only a few more logs remaining. Grandpa Ken took care of filling the wood basket each morning and always let Joseph know when they would have to go chop wood again. He grabbed the few remaining logs and carried them back to the house. They would burn through these by evening for sure.

He set down the basket and opened the stove door. Ashes from the night before he swept with a tiny whisk broom into a tin can and set it aside. Then he placed two of the logs inside, the smaller one resting at an angle on top of the larger. Then he grabbed some old newspaper and magazines from the pile and tore it into tinder, then placed it all around the crooks and under and over top of the logs. He took one of the long stem matches from the box and ran it slowly against the striker, taking pleasure in the crackling sound it made as the phosphorous ignited and the flame whipped in the air. He lit the tinder and made sure it caught well enough to light the smaller fuel log. Then he closed the door and waited.

Twenty minutes and there was enough heat coming off the stove to heat the kitchen and living area. His mother came out in a bathrobe rubbing her arms for warmth.

“Grandpa didn’t get up again?”

“No, ma’am.”

“How many logs you got in there?”

“Two. A small one and a big one.”

She saw the basket with only one log remaining.

“How come you didn’t get more wood? We’re gonna need it today.”

“There ain’t no more.”

His mothers eyes widened.

“What do you mean there ain’t no more?”

“I went out to the woodpile and there was only a few logs left. I guess we used them all up.”

Beth sat down at the kitchen table, her eyes not focused on nothing particular.

“Grandpa Ken must have forgot to say something about it.”

“I can go chop some wood now.”

“Why don’t you walk to Pastor Joseph’s farm, ask if he can spare a few logs just for today, then we’ll worry about that. I need to go see if Grandpa is alright. You had breakfast?”

“No, ma’am.”

“Eat you some leftover biscuits with jelly. I’ll have something hot for you to eat once you get back.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Joseph grabbed a hard biscuit from the bowl on the counter. He spread some strawberry jelly on it and scarfed it down with a glass of water from the tap. His mother checked on grandfather, who was still asleep. Joseph took the only log from the basket and set it on the floor, then he headed out, but he mother stopped him.

“Be sure to thank the pastor and ask if he can come to dinner one night soon, say Monday. We need to do what we can to thank him properly for all he’s done for us these last few days.”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Joseph ran out the door. The biscuit and jelly had given him strength to face the cold of the day. He walked at a brisk pace down the drive towards Oakwood Estates.

Nebulous clouds hung low in the orange-gray sky, moving slowly to the East. A few bright rays of sunlight scattered through them and every once in awhile a spot of blue appeared. Rain and sleet was forecast for later and possibly snow by nightfall.

As he came around the bend to the first row of trailers he saw Jesse Black and gang at the far end of the Estates. They were playing next to the sign at the entrance. Ignacio was swinging a long stick like a sword at Maurice. Jesse was looking at something in the ground. He decided right then he wanted no part of whatever they were up to this morning.

He turned to walk along the row of trailers on the perimeter of the Estates, cutting across the gravel road onto the grass, and then into the small packs of pine trees that connected to the woods behind Pastor Jacob’s farm house and the church. It would take longer by this route but he would try his luck.

There were thick bushes with briars at every line through the pine trees. But he had on his winter boots and gloves and stomped them down the best he could. Eventually he fought through the thickest of them and made good progress. He kept close to the tree line so that he wouldn’t get lost. These woods went back for acres, maybe miles, up the mountain.

As he walked he watched Jesse and the others, hoping to keep out of their line of sight. The basket got hung on twigs and limbs every fifteen feet or so and he had to stop and untangle it. As he went he became more and more agitated.

Once he had been walking for fifteen minutes the cold had penetrated the cap that insulated his ears and he felt them turning numb. His fingers and toes also were beginning to sting from the exposure.

Now he was clear on the other side of the road, coming down to where Jesse, Maurice, and Ignacio were, so he went deeper into the woods. It was clear enough here but that worried him because he could clearly seem them from where he was and he knew that meant they could see him too. If they spotted him here they would know for sure he was trying to avoid them and cause trouble just to spite him.

Then he ran into a fallen pine and tripped over it hard and landed against another tree. A loud *uummppphh* escaped him and the sound echoed to the place where he didn’t want it to go.

The boys stopped what they were doing and looked at the pines, unsure what they were seeing. As Joseph rose to his feet they recognized him and instantly sprinted in that direction.

Joseph cursed and started running as fast as he could through the pines. He darted over and under the hanging limbs, quickly determining they would gain ground on him this way, so he made the decision to actually go deeper into the woods, in the most direct path away from them he could go.

His feet carried him deeper and deeper into those woods. The light grew dimmer as the canopy of trees fell thicker overhead. He did try to keep a little in the direction of Jacob’s farm. His hope was that he would eventually come out the back side of his land.

“Bastard boy!” He heard them shouting through the trees.

“I saw him go that way.” Ignacio said.

Their voices were closer overtime they spoke. Joseph began to fear what they would do to him out here in the woods where nobody could see. Where Jacob was not around to stop them. He remembered the dead glare that Jesse had given him the last time they fought. It was a look of blood. Of murder.

He came to a place where a large overgrowth of kudzu and vines had enveloped some rotting fallen trees. Without thinking he leapt into the patch of leaves and was instantly hidden.

Soon the pack of boys followed him into the same space. Joseph did not seem to draw even one breath while they were in his line of sight. He watched them approach from the far wood line. But from where he was they could not see him, tucked down between two fallen trees and covered with the kudzu.

They walked nearby and argued amongst themselves where he could have gone. And then, just like that, they were gone again. This time headed back to the road. Or the direction he thought the road was. To be honest he was lost at this point.

Joseph waited there in the kudzu for ten minutes or more. When enough time had passed since the last time he heard their voices or footsteps. Then he came out, still holding the basket. Cuts and scrapes on his face.

He took off in what he thought was the right direction and walked at a pace right before a jog.

Minutes passed and he was concerned he had gotten completely turned around. He almost had decided to turn back the way he came when he emerged onto a paved road winding around a curve.

He recognized it as a bend in the state road that ran by the road to their house. He followed the road and stayed out of the way of cars until he saw the familiar sign for New Calvary Baptist Church. There were no cars in the lot. He took a shortcut through the parking lot and headed back to Jacob’s farm house. 

When he reached the porch he took a moment to catch his breath and then knocked on the door. Jacob came to the door after some time, the warmth from inside like the blast from a furnace, warming the fresh scratches on his cheeks. A wide smile came to his face when he recognized him.

“Joseph.”

“Pastor,” Joseph huffed, still out of breath. All of a sudden he felt ashamed to be there, ashamed to be carrying the empty basket. He couldn’t say why.

Jacob waited for him to speak but when he didn’t he pushed open the screen door and stood aside.

“Well, would you like to come in for a moment? Its awfully cold out this morning.”

Joseph held tightly onto the basket and walked inside, avoiding eye contact.

The place was nothing like he imagined. The interior felt like the home of an elderly couple who had passed away a long time ago. Antique trinkets adorned old-fashioned furniture, wooden and covered in dust. Down the hall he saw the entrance to a dining room. The table was draped in a threadbare table cloth, on a shelf behind sat a nice set of oriental dish ware. In the next room there was a large fireplace in the next room, a den. The hearth was made from pale marble that stood out from the otherwise wooden interior walls. There were photographs on the walls and on shelves but Joseph had the feeling they were not Jacob’s but perhaps from the last family. It was dark, cave-like. No light from outside came in through the windows which were covered by a layer of plastic and thin sheets of various colors. 

Jacob showed him to the couch and he sat down, placing the basket beside him as if it were a guest too. The couch was large and made of old leather, cracked, and as he sunk into it his feet raised up in the air.

Jacob closed the door behind them and then disappeared down a hallway that went straight back into darkness, but a few seconds later he saw lights in the kitchen flicker on and then heard cabinets open and close, silverware clanking. He looked around the place.

The only modern thing in the place was the color television, which was set on top of an older and larger television cabinet. It was switched onto the news but the volume was turned down.

The stucco walls and ceiling in the living room area were covered in suit and grime. They had once been white he supposed but not for many years. For decoration there were several paintings of religious themes on the walls. The largest was a black velvet painting of Jesus kneeling in prayer beside a rock, his gaze fixed on a bright star just out of frame, its rays beaming down onto his serene face. Smaller paintings lined the walls around the room in something like a chronology of the life of Jesus: birth in the manger, baptism by John, trials in the desert, sermon on the mount, miracles, last supper, but missing was the crucifixion.

Jacob returned carrying two mugs with steam rising from them. He handed one to Joseph and sat in the recliner underneath the velvet Jesus. They sipped in silence but it was not too uncomfortable.

“Cider. Leftover from Cornucopia. I took a gallon home.”

“Yes, sir,” Joseph agreed, “Its very good hot.”

“I always like during the winter. I’m not a coffee drinker.”

Joseph nodded but did not respond.

“So, what do I owe the pleasure this fine morning?”

“We ran out of wood. Grandpa takes care of the wood but he hasn’t been himself lately. He usually lights the stove in the morning to heat the house but this morning he didn’t get up, so I got up to do it but saw there was no more wood in the pile. Well, except for a few pieces, but that won’t last the day.”

Jacob nodded thoughtfully and then replied.

“That won’t be a problem, Mr. Joseph. The church has a large stockpile behind the storage building. We keep it stocked all year round. I don’t use much myself and the church only uses its fireplace on special occasions. Tell you what. After we finish our cider I’ll get the pickup truck and we’ll load up as much as we can carry and take it to your place. Sound like a plan?”

Joseph smiled. Now he wouldn’t have to lug a basket of wood past Jesse Black and his gang, but he didn’t tell the pastor that. He nodded and took another sip of the cider, then after some time he felt like he ought to say something to break the silence.

“It sure is cold outside.”

“That it is,” Jacob agreed, “but, no sense in staying that way when we have the know-how to build a fire. Yalls place doesn’t have a furnace?”

“It does. But grandpa said its old and give out and we need to replace the whole thing. So we’ve been making due with that old wood burning stove. It’s enough for the downstairs, if we keep the doors open at night. Wasn’t bad when we first moved in, but now that winter is here.”

“Lord,” Jacob said, “so you are in need of a roof and a furnace?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Well that just don’t seem right. But the church is doing what it can, Mr. Joseph. You can count on that. We’ve already raised a pretty penny.”

“I know you are, sir. And my mama wanted to thank you for all you’ve done for us. She asked me to invite you to dinner sometime this week, if you are able.”

“Well sure.”

They finished the cider. Jacob took the cups into the kitchen and washed them out. Then he asked Joseph if he wanted to help feed the chickens before they got started with the wood. Joseph agreed. Jacob put on his heavy black coat and wrapped a green scarf around his neck. Then he slid on some boots, stomping them on the hard wood to get his foot all the way in. He slid on some work gloves and showed Joseph to the door.

They walked to the shed and at the shed Jacob performed the normal routine of handing the feed outside for Joseph to carry, but this time when he was finished he carried out a small black case of some kind and shut the door with a shove of his shoulder.

“Put that feed down for a second,” Jacob said, “I have something I want to show you.”

Joseph set the feed next to the shed. Jacob knelt beside him on the ground, his knee crunching into the frost. He held out the black case and gestured for Joseph to take it from him, which he did. The case was heavier than it looked. New but with no markings to indicate what it contained.

“What’s inside?”

“Open it and find out.”

It did not take him long to figure out how to unlatch the leather tab and flip open the case. Inside he found a brand-new pocket survival knife. It had a stainless steel serrated edge blade, black anodized, and had two other components, a marlin spike and a compass on the end. The body had a red rubber grip.

“It’s just like the ones they sell at the flea market.”

“So you like it?”

“It’s awesome.”

He flipped open the blade, locking it into place, and brandished it through the air like a sword, admiring its edge in the morning sunlight.

“Think you could use something like that?”

Joseph looked at him incredulous.

“Are you serious?”

“If you want it. It’s yours.”

“Thank you,” Joseph said, “But why?”

“It isn’t polite to ask why a gift is given. Only accept or do not accept.”

Jacob smiled and then rose. He feathered Joseph’s hair and picked up the feed. Joseph put the knife in his pocket and then they headed towards the barn. 

Because the weather had gone below freezing, Pastor Jacob had started putting the chickens inside a coop in the barn at night, only letting them out if it was not too cold. There were feeders in the barn, but he still liked to feed them by hand.

When they reached the barn Jacob flipped open the wooden latch and swung open the large doors. An earthy smell of hay and manure came out. It was dark inside, illuminated mostly by the cracks in the wall panels and at the bottom where the wall didn’t come all the way down. The chickens were cooped in the the back of the barn past a bench where Jacob did all his carpentry work. They walked back there.

“It’s too cold to let them out today,” Jacob said, “let’s just toss some feed through the pen and go get the wood.”

But there was a silence in the barn they both noticed as they made their way to the pen. At each footstep Jacob became more concerned. Then when they reached the coop both of them stopped and stared.

There on the dirt floor of the coop, among the droppings and scattered pieces of hay, were all the chickens, pulled apart and bleeding on the dirt floor. Feathers were strewn all over the ground, the wire. There had been some kind of struggle. On the back end of the coop a large opening was in the wire, dug under and tore up in pieces. It was such a mess that it was hard to tell exactly how many chickens there were. The chaos of feathers of all different colors were intermingled with body pieces, a head here, feet here, guts everywhere.

“My God,” Jacob said. For some time that was the only thing he said.

He and Joseph opened the pen and looked around for any chicken still alive but none were. At some point it became obvious there wasn’t anything left to do except clean the carnage. Jacob dropped to his knees inside the pen and a look of distraught came over his face. A hopeless look.

Joseph went back to the shed to get the shovel and wheelbarrow, anything else he thought they might need to clean up. When he returned Jacob was in the same spot looking into the distance.

“What did this?” Joseph finally got the courage to ask him. That small voice in the silence of the barn brought Jacob ought of his reverie and he turned to Joseph with a solemn gaze.

“Hard to say,” Jacob said, “but we have to find out, for my sake and others in the neighborhood. Are you up to the task, Joseph? Will you help me track it down?”

He thought of the dog, the mutt they tortured on the road, and how Jacob had saved it from them. He thought of it and looked for any kind of recognition in Jacob’s eyes that he was also thinking of the same dog. But he found none and would not mention it.

“I will,” Joseph agreed. 

At that Jacob took one of the shovels and went back to the pen. Joseph pushed the wheelbarrow to the opening and they both started to work.

An hour later they were finished. They took the remains of the chickens to the fire pit where Jacob said he would burn them later that night. When they took the tools back to the shed Jacob turned to him without warning and placed both hands on his shoulders, speaking to him in a voice more severe than anything he had yet heard from him.

“Tell no one about the knife I gave you, Joseph. Keep it a secret between you and me.”


Chapter Six


It was evening when the sun had just dropped behind the power plant towers to the west and a muted light still lingered in the sky. Outside the kitchen window you could still make out the shapes of the trailers and the line of trees where the woods began. It was cold as it had been the last few days, but since the wood stove had been burning for some time it was warm in the house kitchen where Beth, Joseph, and Lizzie were preparing dinner for the guest of honor. Jacob would be there in a couple hours.

At the moment Beth was sweeping the floor. She moved around the room as if dancing with a partner, enjoying the work, humming a song that had no words or melody. Just a song. Lizzie and Joseph joined her in singing the wordless song, each involved in their own task. Joseph was peeling potatoes for the roast and Lizzie was picking up her toys and placing them in the plastic box next to the window.

Joseph saw how happy his mother was. It had been a long time since she was in a mood like this. It made him angry in a way he could not understand. He was halfway through peeling the potatoes when he cut his thumb on the paring knife and winced. But he hid it from the rest of them and just ran water over it until the bleeding stopped. When he finished with the potatoes he chopped them in quarters and set them in the pan with the carrots and onions, all around the large roast which was salted and peppered. He showed his mother and she opened the stove door and slid it in and turned the knob on the timer for ninety minutes.

Then he helped his sister pick up toys because she was not doing a very good job. Once all the toys were in the box Beth asked Joseph to help clean up Beth and help her put on the red dress she had washed and ironed. Then Beth went to get ready.

Joseph took his sister to the bathroom they shared and washed her face with a cloth rag. She squirmed and winced, trying to get away.

“Be still. I gotta clean you up.”

“I’m clean.”

“No you aint. You look like a pig.”

Then he took her into their bedroom and took off her dirty shirt and pants and slid the red dress overhead.

“Raise your arms.”

“Why we have to dress up?” Lizzie asked.

Joseph told her to sit on the bed and then put on her clean socks and two black patent leather dress shoes.

“Because the Pastor is coming over for dinner tonight and we want to make a good impression.”

“The bald-headed man?”

“Yes.”

Once Lizzie was dressed Joseph put on his Sunday clothes, his dress pants, button up shirt, and belt. He didn’t have any nice shoes but he had cleaned his sneakers earlier at his mother’s request. He walked them both into the hallway bathroom where their mother was getting ready. She walked out and Joseph was surprised to see his mother in a pretty blue dress, her hair curled, and wearing makeup.

“Mama, you look pretty!”

“Thank you, Lizzie. Don’t you look like a doll.”

Beth licked her thumb and rubbed out a dirt smudge on Lizzie’s cheek that Joseph had missed. She took her hairbrush and brushed Lizzie’s hair until it was nice and smooth, then clipped it up on either side with two barrettes. She admired Lizzie and then turned to Joseph.

“You clean up nice, handsome. Let me brush out that rat’s nest.”

She started to brush out Joseph’s hair but he shirked away.

“I can do it myself.”

Beth looked hurt but handed Joseph the brush. He proceeded to pull the brush through his hair. It caught on tangle after tangle that he fought through. But eventually his hair too looked nice and smooth.

The hearty aroma of the roast beef drifted through the house. Beth asked Joseph to check on it to make sure the potatoes were cooked through, and if so, to uncover and cook another fifteen minutes. Then she returned to her makeup and hair.

Joseph took Lizzie to the main room where she got out all the toys they had just put up a half hour ago. Then he went to the stove to check on the roast. As he opened the door to the oven a wave of heat and the thick smell both hit him in the face. He took the pot warmers and lifted the lid to test out a potato. It was just about done so he removed the lid completely and closed the oven door again.

When Beth finished getting ready she came into the kitchen and started on the cornbread. She asked Joseph to go knock on Grandpa Ken’s door to make sure he knew company would be arriving soon. Beth had told him earlier but wanted to make sure he was ready to greet Jacob when he first got there.

Joseph walked to the door at the back room and knocked.

“Grandpa?”

“What do you need, Joseph?”

“Mama asked me to check on you.”

“Be out shortly.”

“Okay.”

When he came back a light shone through the kitchen window and moved across the wall. It was the Pastor. Beth put in the cornbread and gave Lizzie a once-over, then threw a few stray toys into the box. She patted down the dress she wore and smoothed out a few wrinkles. Then she went to the door and opened it. A breath of the cold night air blew in and caused them all to shiver.

Joseph heard the Pastor coming up the steps. Apparently he had come in the Vega, now repaired, and wanted to show Beth. She went out with Lizzie and Joseph watched them outside, their silhouettes visible from the car lights. A minute later they came in, complaining about the cold.

Jacob came inside wearing a long dress coat and a hat of all things. He too was dressed for the evening, in a suit. Beth took his coat and hat and placed them on the dresser in Joseph and Lizzie’s room since they had no coat rack. Beth asked Jacob if he wanted some coffee and he agreed. Then they all took spots around the kitchen table and smiled at one another. Jacob turned to Joseph.

“Well Mr. Joseph, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you look so sharp. You clean up nice.”

Beth laughed, “That’s what I was saying. He’ll be beating off the girls pretty soon.”

Joseph looked at his feet as they praised him. Then Jacob turned his attention to Lizzie who could not stop staring at the Pastor, though she said nothing.

“And you, little one. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an angel quite so lovely.”

Lizzie walked up to Jacob and he lifted her onto his lap. She seemed fascinated by his beard and pulled it. He played like he was hurt and made her laugh. Then she looked up at his head.

“You’re bald,” she said.

“Did I leave my hair at home again?” Jacob asked, feigning surprise, “I knew I forgot something at the house!”

Then he tickled her belly and set her down. Lizzie beamed and walked over to her mother. Beth stood there, unsure what to say, happy to have brought them all together. Jacob looked at Beth and admired her.

“You lovely tonight.”

And Beth blushed.

“Thank you, Mister Jacob. You are quite handsome yourself. I’m glad you came. I think dinner is just about ready.”

She walked to the stove and checked on the roast. It was done so she pulled it out and set it on the burners. Steam rose from the meat and vegetables when she lifted off the lid. She asked Joseph to grab some plates and lay the table, which he did. 

Then from the back of the house a door opened and closed again. A moment later Grandpa Ken emerged from down the hall, dressed up in a tan dress slacks, a button down shirt with pearl buttons, and bolo tie. His white-gray hair slicked back in the old fashion, slightly parted to the side. He stepped into the room with most of his weight placed on a wooden cane in his left hand. Joseph had never seen his grandfather dressed up like that before. He watched as his grandfather made his way slowly, but resolutely across the room to the Pastor and held out his hand.

“Pastor.”

A solemn look fell over Jacob as he took Grandpa Ken’s hand.

“Pleased to me you at last, Mr. Hight. Call me Jacob. A lovely family you have. I’m proud to be invited here tonight.”

Now that dinner was ready they all took seats around the kitchen table. There was really only space for four, but Joseph had brought in a spare foldout chair from the den and set it next to  Lizzie who sat in a booster seat next to him. Joseph helped grandpa by pulling out his chair at the head of the table. This agitated him and he leaned the cane against the back of the chair and placed both hands on the back wresting it from Joseph’s control. The boy stepped away and went to the counter to help his mother bring over the plates and dishes.

“What we having tonight Bethy? Smells good.”

“Now Grandpa Ken, I showed you that roast beef before I put it into the oven earlier. We’re having that with some potatoes and onions, and then cornbread and butter.”

“Mmm, good.”

Grandpa set down in the seat uneasily and grinned at Lizzie who was watching him. Jacob waited until Grandpa had sat down before he took a seat at the opposite end of the table. He did not make much eye contact with anyone except for Lizzie.

Beth brought over the roast and vegetables on a dinner platter and set it in the middle of the table. Joseph brought over a small plate with the cornbread cut into triangles and a stick of butter.

“How can we afford to eat like this?” Grandpa asked, pointing at the hearty spread, “Where we got money for that?”

Beth blushed and turned away to the sink to hide her embarrassment.

“Nevermind about that, Mr. Ken. You know I get an employee discount at work sometimes. We can afford a meal like this for a special occasion at least.”

She poured everyone tea into tupperware cups and brought them over to the table. Then she and Joseph took their places at the table. Everyone adjusted in their seats and Beth led them all by  resting both arms on the table in a gesture of prayer. They all looked down.

“Lord,” Beth said, “Bless this meal we are so grateful for and bless the man in whose honor we came together this evening to celebrate and bless you Lord for the life you have given us, amen.”

“Amen,” Jacob repeated.

With that everyone dug in and dished themselves a plate. Beth handed Joseph the carving knife and asked him to slice a few large pieces and some smaller ones. Once everyone had a plate and started to eat, Beth spoke up one more time.

“Y’all go ahead and eat but I just wanted to say a few words.”

She stopped as if to collect her thoughts. Everyone turned and faced her. Jacob smiled.

“Mr. Brumbalow, I don’t know how to thank you for what you have done for us over the last couple weeks and what you are still doing at the church. It’s been a hard time for us this past year and you’re the only one whose been kind enough to lend a helping hand. You are a Christian through and through and the Lord has blessed us by bringing you into our lives, and I wanted to invite you into our home tonight to thank you for that and to show you it does not go unappreciated.”

When she stopped everyone was silent. Jacob was the first to respond, which he did in a quiet voice, as if speaking to Beth alone.

“Ma’am, the gift of charity is a gift to the giver as much as to the receiver. I have learned that in my years as Pastor and understand it well. So thank you, ma’am. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a lovely, gentle family as yours. It breaks my heart to see the misfortune you have had to endure and do endure today. I feel compelled from the bottom of my heart to ease your burden by whatever means the Lord has provided me. Again, thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”

Joseph bowed his head as he finished and did not look up again for several moments. Beth brought up a napkin to wipe away a few tears. Even Lizzie, though not understanding the words, did understand the tone and feeling behind the words, and was silent.

“Well,” Beth sighed, “I think its time to eat.”

They all laughed except for Grandpa who sat to himself.

“I’m starving,” Joseph said, and forked a big portion of the roast beef and took a bite.

With that they all dug in. The roast beef had turned out fine, pink in the center, juicy and falling apart in the mouth. The cornbread was rich and slightly sweet which contrasted with the melted butter inside.

Joseph had several helpings. Jacob too. Beth chopped up a small mixture of beef and veggies for Lizzie and fed her before eating her own plate. Grandpa ate little. He poked at his plate with his fork. Somewhere in thought.

“We had replace the alternator,” Jacob explained, “I got Stephen  Echols to help out. He’s good with that kind of stuff. We borrowed Dan Riley’s garage for the tools and the space to work in. It’s heated inside.”

“Well that’s nice,” Beth said.

“What happens is the alternator recharges the battery and if it goes bad your battery slowly drains. So usually you end up replacing it and the battery both. Luckily your battery was still good. Just had to replace the fluid.”

Jacob cut another portion of beef and took a slice of onion. Beth handed him the plate of cornbread and he chose one of the top. She got up to refill his tea and asked everyone else if they needed a refill.

“But so much about the car. Should run good now. Surprised it’s in the shape its in. You don’t see too many of those around.”

“That was my daddy’s car,” Joseph said.

“Oh, I see,” Jacob said, “well its a good one. Anyway its fixed now. But that ain’t the news I’m most excited to tell y’all about.”

Beth sat back down. Jacob smiled from ear to ear.

“As of this afternoon, I know because I had Margaret tally it all, the church of New Calvary Baptist has raised seventy eight hundred dollars for the purposes of repairing the Hight farm roof and to replace the furnace.”

“I can’t believe it!” Beth leaned over and kissed Jacob on the cheek. Lizzie copied her mother and did the same thing. Jacob picked her up on his knee and she gave him a wet slobbery one.

“I don’t know what to say, Pastor. We are indebted to you and the congregation at New Calvary. How can you raise so much money?”

“Well, a portion of that comes directly from an allotment of the church’s income we dedicate to acts of charity in the community. The rest from individual donors who give in secret. Margaret had a bake sale the other day at the Bingo game. Together we can accomplish a lot. You’d be surprised.”

“I feel like I want to thank every last person. I feel like I owe them so much. You don’t know how much that will mean to us this Winter. The draft from that hole, the furnace. The car. I just don’t know.”

Beth began to cry but got up and walked to the kitchen counter. She took a rag and wiped her face.

“I better put in the dessert.”

She took a pan of cinnamon spiced apples from the refrigerator. She covered it up with some foil and slid it into the oven. Then she returned to her seat, placing a hand on Joseph’s shoulder, but he shrugged her off.

“Baked apples and vanilla ice cream.”

“Doesn’t that sound nice,” Jacob said, “Good country dessert. Reminds me of when I was a boy.”

At some point in the dinner Grandpa Ken dropped his silverware onto the plate with a loud clang. Instantly a hush came over them all, with some apprehension in the air of what was to follow. Grandpa rose from his chair, weak, shaky. He took his cane and rested upon it and stared right into Pastor Jacob’s eyes. He then spoke in the wheezing, halting voice of the elderly, but it was clear there was a powerful feeling behind it.

“I want you out of my goddamn house.”

Everyone at the table drew in their breaths. But they were too struck to respond. Jacob met the words with a sadness in his gaze, but he let the elder speak his mind.

“You all think I’m old. I am old but I still see things. Some things I see better. And what I see here is a disgrace and a wickedness I don’t rightly know the name for.”

Grandpa Ken paused between his words, collecting thoughts, wanting to make sure he said it the right way.

“Get the hell out before I throw you out you goddamn son of a bitch. I know your kind. I know what it is you do.”

Beth threw a napkin on her plate and rose violently.

“Kenneth Hight, there is no place for that kind of talk here. I won’t stand for it! Jacob hasn’t done anything to deserve those kind of words. Hateful man!”

But Jacob rose with her and placed his hand on her shoulder. She turned to him and he saw her tears but gestured for her to sit back down. She did and he followed. Grandpa said nothing during all this. He only waited, and then continued.

“Hasn’t he? No, I suppose he hasn’t. His kind works that way. Slithering. For me there is no God. No devil either. There is only the world. The world and our survival within it. But people expect the devil. They expect the horns and the tail. They look for those markers they can see from a mile away. But there is no such thing as that. Do you follow me? Do my words make sense to your ears? It’s hard for me to tell. I used to know. But no more.”

Grandpa looked at Lizzie, who was transfixed at the anger which proceeded from the mouth of her loving grandfather. He looked to Joseph who did not give any indication that he understood. Beth suppressed her anger. Jacob looked at him in pity.

“How does evil come into the world? Not through war, chaos, murder, theft. Those come after. At first it is a smile. Laughter. Gifts. Seduction. This is not a spiritual matter. There is no such thing. This is mechanics plain and simple. The mechanics of evil.”

“This man has invaded our family. He wants us to forget the memory of my son, your husband, and your father. Don’t forget Will. My son. Your husband and your father.”

Ken pointed to Beth and then the Joseph, but they only looked at their plates in silence.

“Please stop,” Beth pleaded, “you have ruined our dinner with this crazy talk. We wanted to have a nice dinner tonight to thank the nice man who has helped us. And you ruined that for us. Why?”

“Why don’t you see what he is? Why don’t you see what I see? He ain’t come here to help but to conquer. To possess. And he won’t ever stop. Not ever.”

Grandpa became more and more angry and his words made less and less sense. He wandered over to the couch next to the window and sat down, defeated. He could not express his thoughts clearly enough and that frustrated him. He was too old to express them with eloquence and they had come out rambling, insane. Everyone was embarrassed for him and worst of all he knew it.

Everyone at the table was quiet until Jacob himself rose. He placed his hand on Beth’s shoulder and whispered something into her ear. As he came around the table he put his hand on Joseph and then Lizzie, who looked up at him. Then he walked over to Grandpa Ken.

As he reached Grandpa he reached out his hand and placed it upon his forehead, pushing up the fallen gray strands of hair. There he knelt as if praying. Then it became clear he was praying. His mouth uttered words inaudible to the ears. Grandpa opened his eyes and saw Jacob there. Then he did something neither Joseph, Lizzie, or Beth had ever seen. He wept.

Jacob stopped his prayer and met Grandpa Ken’s eyes. He reached out and pulled him close, wrapping both arms around him in a large embrace. And he did not let go. Grandpa wept more.

Joseph felt like the floor beneath him was falling away, like all the things he had previously thought about life and the people in his life was upside down and could no longer be trusted. He watched the dinner table fall through the hole in the floor, his mother, Lizzie, the wood stove. It all spiraled downward into the dark hole that was there. It was all there was. He had looked at his grandfather as a beacon of strength and wisdom, truth. And now that illusion was shattered. Yet Jacob was there. Strong and resolute. He did not sink into the hole.

Grandpa pulled away and collapsed onto the couch like a child. Like a boy. His shaky gaze cast upward at Jacob who stood over him. But then he too sank onto the couch beside Grandpa. His hand reached out to wipe the brow of sweat from the old man’s wrinkled brow.

“Bring some water, Beth,” Jacob said, “Bring a warm wash cloth.”

Beth brought them over and stood there unsure what to do or say. Jacob took the rag and wiped it over Grandpa’s face, then held up the cup of water to his lips. He drank without resistance.

“Are you okay, Mr. Hight?”

His face was pale, his eyes rolled. Breaths taken in like fish gulps, rapid and deep.

“What’s a matter with Grandpa?” Lizzie asked her mother, grabbing onto the bottom of her shirt.

“He is sick honey.”

“Oh.”

Jacob spoke to Kenneth in a loud, steady voice in order to bring his mind back to the room. He snapped two fingers in front of him.

“Mr. Hight, are you okay? Do you need an ambulance? Speak if you are able.”

Grandpa turned to Jacob. Rather his eyes rolled in that direction. His head lay still against the couch cushion. In a strained voice he spoke.

“Where’s Inny?”

Jacob turned to Beth to see if she understood.

“Inez was his first wife. She died of pneumonia decades ago.”

“Inez is in Heaven, Mr. Hight. She is in Heaven now.”

“Not in Heaven,” Grandfather said, “No. Not in Heaven. And not on Earth.”

“That is not what Christians believe. That is not what we believe.”

The old man coughed and wheezed. He found it humorous.

“It doesn’t matter what you believe. It doesn’t matter what I believe. It only matters what is.”

“This is my house. We lived in this house. This same house. Mama, Daddy, little Gracie. We worked them fields. Cows in the fields. Had to feed them, milk them. Ever day. Rain or shine. Work to be done. Dairy farm. Weekends they held dances in the old school house. Stacked desks on the wall. Made a dance floor. Had music. Jim Masingill and his brothers had a band. They used to pick flowers and sell em at the door. Buy a flower for your girl. Them boys lined on the walls. Scared to talk to the pretty girls. Wearing those dresses. Flour sack dresses, yes sir. She was there too. First time I saw her I knew she was mine. Mine forever. Inny. Soft hair, shy eyes. Small hands. Like a bird.”



"Think I don't know. Think I don't know that you laugh at me. I know more than you think I do. Think I was always old? Think my mind was always confused? Once I was strong. Once I was witty. Made jokes. Once I felt pity for the aged and the poor. With a solemn and respectful face I gave money to those in need. In so many small ways I lorded it over them. All the time welling up with pride at my goodness, sometimes to the verge of tears at my benevolence. How vain I was. How useless and vain. What did I know about loss then? It all goes to shit. God and Jesus and the Holy Ghost. Virgin birth. Walking on water. The resurrection. That's the lie. The only truth in this world is disintegration. There will be no reunion. What is gone will not come again." 

"Respectfully sir, you are mistaken. And I've dedicated my life to sharing the Good News that has been revealed to us through the life and death of our Savior, Jesus Christ. That is my belief."

"Respectfully sir, it doesn't matter what you believe. And it doesn't matter what I believe. It only matters what is."

That he would lose it over and over again. Florene. If I only understood what it meant to lose my love to eternity. I lost her. Every moment I didn’t want to be in her presence. I remember a summer night I left the house and went for a walk and I cursed her. And now what I wouldn’t give. It doesn’t matter. Nothing else matters. Nothing! That’s what they don’t tell you about life. That all the rest is horseshit. Your job, money, house, car. Horseshit. They don’t tell you that and then by the time you finally understand its too late. Love. More real than those things. I can’t say what I mean. I won’t never again be that boy who got up courage to ask her to go with me to the Shannon barn dance and took her outside and kissed her under the stars that night. She was my love. Mine.

And there ain’t no Heaven. No after life. No reunification will bring that love back to me again. Don’t bullshit me.
