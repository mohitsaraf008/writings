It was still dark when grandpa came to wake him. 

“Slip on your long johns,” he whispered with a finger held to his mouth, “and try not to wake Lizzie, savvy?”

At that he left the room.

The boy rolled from under the warmth of his sleeping bag onto the cold wood. Wobbling in place for nearly a minute he finally became conscious enough to feel how cold it was in the room. He kicked his legs in place and rubbed his bare arms together to get some circulation going. Once his eyes had become adjusted to what little light there was he crept over to the chest of drawers. He pulled open the middle drawer but it creaked despite his most cautious movement. He winced and went utterly still, but his sister didn’t stir. After a moment he slid on his long johns and then a few more layers of pants, shirts, a sweater. He grabbed his survival knife from its place on the nightstand and joined his grandfather in the main room.

Heat from the stove in the kitchen enveloped him as he came up behind his grandfather at the table and stood there, not fully awake.

“Hold out your arms,” Grandpa said. He noticed Joseph nodding in place, his eyes nearly shut, so he gave one his cheeks a good pinch. His eyes opened wide.

“Hold out your arms.”

In them he placed a newly-sharpened ax, some length of twine, and a rolled up tarp. Joseph could barely carry it all, but shuffled them around until he had a good hold. Grandpa watched him with some amusement.

“Got your knife on you?”

“Yes sir.”

“Biscuit?”

“Yes.”

Grandpa buttered one of the drop biscuits Beth had made the day before, hardened now, but still edible. As Joseph could not carry the biscuit his grandfather placed it in his mouth.

“Ready?”

Joseph mumbled.

“Let’s do it then.”

Out the front door they went but turned left from the porch and  headed towards the shed. There was no moonlight this time of morning and sunlight was just a sliver behind the line of trees on the hills in the distance. But even that was enough to illuminate the snow on the ground and light their way.

Their footsteps crunching through snow and ice was the only sound to be heard this early morning. Their slow but steady march the only movement. Everything else was silent and still on the hill where they lived.

Joseph breathed through an old t-shirt he used to cover his mouth and neck area. He smelled the old sweat warmed by his breath but it was not unpleasant as it reminded him of summer days. His exhalation made a visible puff of air each time, and he noticed his grandfather’s breath do the same.

They walked past the shed to the edge of the woods. It was darker in the woods, but grandfather didn’t miss a step as he stomped a few briars to make a path through for them.

By this point Joseph was not paying much attention to where they were, only following the back of his grandfather’s coat, which he could barely make out, the rough wool material came nearly to his knees. So when his grandfather switched on the flashlight and lit up a ten foot area in front of them, it startled him at first.

The winter woods lit by the flashlight appeared to him to be some alien landscape. Bizarre and menacing. A haze floated through the air, snow or dust they had kicked up. The space between the maples and pines was enough to easily walk through, except for the briars. Luckily grandpa carried a machete and wore his boots.

Another five minutes of walking and they were deep enough so that when Joseph looked back he could no longer see the lights from the kitchen window. All the time the place was getting brighter but here it was still too dark to see, canopied over by the tall trees.

Joseph knew what they were looking for this far in the woods. His grandfather made rounds every few weeks through the woods with two of spray paint and marked ones he thought would make the best firewood and others for carpentry work. He had a system. Orange for firewood. Blue for carpentry. They had passed several orange-marked trees already, but they had not yet seen a blue one.

At one point grandpa stopped and Joseph, not paying attention, ran straight into him and dropped the ax. Grandpa turned around harshly and picked up the ax, then returned to the woods and scratched his head. He shone his light in all directions and finally it landed on a particular midsize pine among several others. On its trunk was a blue ‘X’. They set to work. 

Joseph unfurled the tarp onto the ground while grandfather started chipping away at one side of the tree with ax in one hand, flashlight in the other. Once the cut path was established, grandfather handed the ax to Joseph, showed him how to hold it properly and where to hit on the tree and at what angle. Then he held the flashlight up while Joseph took his swings. The young boy swung wildly but making enough progress with just shear force.

“Don’t wear yourself out,” Grandpa said, “You’re gonna need the strength later.”

Thirty minutes passed and the morning light shone through the bare branches. They no longer needed the flashlight, dim though the light still was. Both grandpa and Joseph had taken turns and were both well tired. Joseph tried do more but his arm was just about give out. Grandpa pushed him on seeing how close they were, the wedge-shaped angle had just about reached the other side.

And then it cracked. Joseph stood back and his grandfather put his boot on the chopped side and pushed.

“Give it a push, Joseph.”

They both pushed the tree hard and finally gave it enough momentum to tear. The tree cracked and fell slow and hard onto the ground, just missing a nearby oak.

After a rest Grandpa picked up the ax and walked a length from the base to about ten foot. At that point he made a notch with the ax and gave a few swings.

“We’ll cut her here, split the log, and then come back later for the rest as firewood. Savvy?”

“Yes sir.”

Joseph took that as his cue to pick up the ax again. For the next hour they took turns chopping through the log, and then once chopped to the right length driving a wedge into a gap and splitting it lengthwise, first into two, then into four.

By now it was morning. A pale light fell over the trees and the ground, covered with snow in places. Joseph looked at his grandfather. He was tired and ready to call it a day. But he knew they still had much to do. His grandfather smiled at him and told him to be tough.

They pulled the split logs onto the tarp and then each grabbed a corner and started the drag out of the woods. It was slow-going but easier than they thought it would be, as heavy as the logs were. They dragged and dragged. Joseph pulled off his cap and the shirt from his neck. He was sweating.

Soon they came to the edge of the woods. Joseph could see his mother in the kitchen from here, now that it was light. She was preparing breakfast. Lizzie was crying for something at her feet. He wanted grandpa to tell them to quit so they could have breakfast and rest. But he couldn’t say so himself. He knew that.

Once they were on the snow the drag was much easier. They pulled it past the shed and over to the fence separating their land from the large field. The broken section was just as it was left, the rotten wood disintegrated into pieces at the post hole.

They pulled the rotten fence rails from the post holes and cleaned it out. The rails fell apart in their hands it was so far gone. “Past time for this,” Grandpa remarked. Joseph nodded in agreement, although really his mind was on eggs and bacon, and fresh biscuits.

The area now clean from all the old rails, they did some last-minute trimming on the new rail ends, just so they would fit into the existing post holes. Then they lifted each end into place, starting at the bottom. Then once that one was in place, it was that much easier to do the next one, resting it on the lower rail.

Once all four rails were in place, grandpa got the roll of twine and told Joseph to get out his knife. Grandpa unspooled about three feet of twine and held it out for Joseph to cut. Joseph flipped open the rusty blade (still sharp) and cut the twine. Then grandpa wrapped it around each post rail join in a figure eight, tucking in the end. He showed Joseph how this was done and they each took another post rail join and finished in less than half an hour.

Once finished, grandpa took a step back and asked Joseph to stand with him. They admired their work. It had taken all morning, nearly five hours. Then they put the old rails onto the tarp and pulled it over to the firepit and unloaded it.

“Bad wood for fence, good wood for fire.”

“Yeah,” Joseph agreed, without really knowing what he was agreeing to, so numb from the work.

The sun was high overhead and it was even warm where they stood together, admiring the morning’s work. The snow was already beginning to melt, cold drops of moisture glistening in the winter sunlight.


JOSEPH THE SON
Daniel Stepp


Chapter One

Four boys got off a school bus at the end of the dirt road that led a quarter mile back to Oakwood Estates, a trailer park that had been built on the abandoned Hight Farm property decades ago. The bus used to drive all the way to the mailboxes, but it had been years since anyone had bothered to gravel the road and there were deep ruts in many spots and hollowed out places with standing water, some a few feet deep.

Three of the boys walked together in a pack. The last followed behind at a distance that seemed conspicuously far.

It was a cool day but not cold. There was a field to their left which connected to several pastures fenced off from the others. Horses and cows. Some bales of hay. A distant barn. On their right a line of pine packs and tall grass obscured what lay beyond, but it was no mystery to them. 

At the corner of state road 53 and the dirt road was the local church, New Calvary Baptist Church. It was a plain brick and mortar building painted white. All church-going residents of Oakwood Estates attended New Calvary, which held services on Sunday morning and Wednesday evening. 

Behind the church itself was a small house and farm where the Pastor lived, a man named Jacob Brumbalow. He had been the pastor here for the last few years, an Alabamian by birth, a fact he could never quite live down. He was out in the yard behind his house this afternoon walking among his chickens. He fed them handfuls from a small burlap bag and they pecked greedily at his feet. Jacob waved to the boys but none of the pack of three acknowledged his wave and the last only nodded.

As soon as they were were sure Pastor Jacob could not see them, one of the boys in the pack of three pulled a round green can from his back pocket. He pinched off a plug of tobacco and passed the can around to the others. Soon after that he turned behind him and spit in the direction of the lone boy, giving him a hostile glare.

One of the others noticed and looked back. He stopped momentarily. The other two stopped also.

“Yo, want some dip?” The boy said. His name was Maurice Mayes, “It’s legit. Red Man Special.”

“He don’t want no dip,” one of the others said, “Look at him. He a mamas boy.”

The boy looked at the ground and did not answer. He kept walking and when he reached the others he went wide around them. Now he was in front of them.

The others grinned at one another and kept walking. The oldest boy, a fair-haired and lanky teen named Jesse Black picked up a rock and hurled it. The rock bounced off his heal, cutting him, but he did not, could not, acknowledge the pain.

“Better watch out Jesse,” said the Mexican kid, Ignacio Gomez, “He’s liable to knock you out.”

“He know better than that. He don’t wanna die.”

The others laughed.

The lone boy, Joseph, kept walking at an even pace. Slowly the others caught up to him. They made fun of his jacket, his hair, the way he walked. Jesse in particular antagonized him with threats and got even angrier when Joseph did not respond.

“Hey boy, I’m talking to you!” Jesse said, “Hey!”

“Hey,” Joseph said at last, but that was all.

Jesse stood in front of Joseph and both of them stopped. The others turned to watch.

“You a smart alec or something? I’ll break your fuckin jaw.”

Jesse took steps closer to Joseph, who continued to look at the ground in silence. He could smell a mixture of tobacco and body odor coming from Jesse and it made him want to wretch.

“Look at me boy.”

Joseph looked up and their eyes met. Jesse was taller, stronger, and his eyes meaner than his. They said nothing in words until the tension was unbearable.

“Yo check out that dog, man,” Maurice suddenly said, breaking the tension, “That’s an ugly dog. Where he came from I wonder?”

The other boys, including Joseph, looked at what Maurice had found. There on the road, limping along, was a mutt of some kind. Mangy. About half dead.

Jesse turned away from Joseph altogether and joined Maurice and Ignacio. They approached the dog from different angles, curious and cautious.

“Here boy,” Ignacio said, holding out his hand, “You’re good. You’re good.”

“Nice boy,” Maurice said.

The dog was afraid of them. It tried to creep into the high grass to hide but was too slow. Jesse jumped behind it and scared it in the other direction. Towards Joseph.

“Don’t let him get away!” Maurice shouted at Joseph.

Joseph, not knowing what to do, blocked the dog from sneaking around him. It was too weak to bite. You could see its ribs on the underbelly.

Now the others encircled the mutt in each direction. It turned to see that it was trapped. Ignacio grabbed some sticks from a pile of brush and tossed them to the others, to Joseph.

“Keep him still,” Maurice said, “Don’t let him get past you.”

“That’s the game,” Ignacio said, laughing.

“If he gets by you,” Maurice hesitated, a loss of words.

“If he gets by you what?” Jesse said.

“If he gets by you, you gotta lick a cat’s butthole.”

The boys all laughed.

As the mutt approached any one of them he batted his stick on the ground and that frightened it in the opposite direction. After a few minutes of this it became clear they would be there for a long time if that was the only game to be played. But no boy wanted to be the one to let the dog get away.

Joseph caught eyes with Jesse and saw hostility. They were not friends. Their confrontation from minutes ago was not forgotten in his eyes. He felt strange. Outside himself. But laughed along with them as if he were one of them.

At that point Ignacio let his guard down and the dog slipped by him and scurried further down the road.

“Get him!”

“Don’t let him get away!”

One of the dog’s feet was injured so it wasn’t hard to get around in front of him and block the way. Joseph and Jesse ran the fastest. Maurice grabbed his book bag and stood behind, while Ignacio came around the side. Before long they had the dog encircled once again.

Maurice said, “This game old man. How bout we do something else? I got an idea.”

“What you got?”

Maurice reached behind him and unzipped the small pouch on his bag. He pulled out a small binder clip.

“Okay,” he said, “This is the game. One of you has to put this clip on that dogs tail. Whoever does that is the bravest one.”

“Man, you’re crazy,” Ignacio said, “that dog will bite the hell out of you, if you get that close. Look how mad he is already.”

“Scared,” Jesse said, taunting him.

“You do it,” Ignacio said.

“I ain’t stupid.”

“Look,” Maurice said, “I got five dollars whoever do it.”

“Quit lyin.”

“For real. Mom gave me cash for meal tickets this week but I didn’t buy them yet.”

“No, I know,” Jesse said, “let this new guy do it. He has to do it. Neighborhood code.”

“Oh,” Ignacio said, nodding, “Yeah, neighborhood code. New guy has to do it. Initiation.”

Joseph looked at the others, at the clip, and at the dog.

“No way. I can’t do that.”

“Why not?” Jesse said, “You chickenshit?”

“I ain’t chickenshit.”

“Then prove it, son,” Maurice said.

“Yeah prove it,” Ignacio repeated.

Joseph looked down the road. He was still far from the old farmhouse where his family lived. Those boys could catch him for sure if he bolted now. And he felt sure they would chase him. Something in their eyes told him. And a part of him wanted to belong, wanted to show them he wasn’t afraid.

He took the clip from Maurice as the others circled tighter around the dog. He had to squeeze with most fingers against his palm to apply enough force to open the clip. The dog looked up in fear at each of them. Joseph took a cautious step forward, awaiting the right moment when the dog’s tail was nearest to him.

“This about to get real.”

“Do it, chickenshit.”

It only took a second for him to reach down and clip the tail, and it caught somewhere in the middle. Gripped it good. The dog immediately panicked and yelped in a high pitch that echoed across the empty field. They boys jumped backwards and stood there watching. Laughing.

Round and round the dog spun, biting at its tail, but it was no good. The clip had a good five pounds of pressure on it, and the dog could not reach it as high up as it was. It growled and yelped until it wore itself out, and then it kept going.

Joseph looked at the dog in horror. He wanted to help it but as fast as it was spinning there was nothing to be done. It would bite for sure now, and bite hard. For survival. So he did nothing except laugh along with the others.

Then somewhere up the road they heard a voice shouting. The pastor Jacob had heard the dog in pain and ran up to meet them.

“What’s going on here?” Jacob shouted, “What have you boys done?”

As soon as he saw the dog, he knelt beside it on one knee and gripped it hard around the torso, removing the clip and releasing the dog in one movement. And just like that the dog was gone, vanishing into the high yellow grass. The pastor held up the binder clip and showed it to them. He then heaved it into the tree packs where it could never be found.

Jacob stood tall. His eyes lifted towards the gray November skiy. And then he shut them as if in prayer. At the horizon a mid-afternoon sunlight fell sharply across the landscape and lit everything unnaturally bright. The pastor’s hands were covered in grime and there was a wound on his left palm. Blood from it intermingled with the grease and dirt and ran a thin river up his forearm. He wrung both hands together, unaware of the injury he had sustained. His breathing was slow, but deep. He did not address the boys right away. He only stood there in a kind of reverie.

A small wind rustled the leaves on the ground and swept across the field grass.

None of the boys dared to speak. Not amongst themselves and not to pastor Jacob. The wild mood from before was gone and it had been replaced with a certain kind of silence. A stillness. Joseph caught eyes with Jesse who immediately looked away. The others stared at the ground.

Then Pastor Jacob opened his eyes and looked at each one of them. Then he spoke.

“Augustine, the Saint, wrote that if it were possible for every sound to become silent and for every movement to become still, in all of creation, then the truth of our existence would be revealed to us. Everything would speak at once, in the same voice. We did not create ourselves. We were made by Him who abideth in Eternity.”

“Creation. You. Me. This dirt road at our feet. The grass. The clouds. The sun. Those chickens. That poor dog. There is a kinship here. It is deeper than species. It is deeper than blood. There is an understanding of life that cannot be taught. It must be understood. You Jesse and you Maurice, you Ignacio, and you, what is your name, son?”

“Joseph.”

“You Joseph, all of you boys are a part of this world. And you share a kinship with everything you meet under the one Creator. And what is your duty towards your kin?”

None of the boys would speak, and after a long period of silence Jacob continued.

“Your duty to your kin is to protect them. To shelter them from harm. Human beings have powerful, powerful minds and we have constructed elaborate systems in the forms of laws and religions to convince ourselves we are not responsible for all, only those of our own species, family, race, culture, religion, society. But that is the lie. That is the lie and each man knows it from the bottom of his heart. And it is a great sin.”

Jacob was breathless for a moment, lost in another world somewhere. As he returned to the dirt road beside the field, among the four boys, he looked around, stupefied. Unaware of his surroundings.

The boys all looked at the ground. All but one. Joseph was looking right into his eyes and they connected.

“I understand you.”

The pastor kneeled beside Joseph and gazed sincerely at him. Joseph did not look away.

“Yes,” Jacob smiled, clasping one hand around his shoulder and gently squeezing, “I see by your eyes that you do.”

“You boys,” Jacob said, rising from his knee, “there is work to be done for Cornucopia and I think it would be a good thing in light of what happened today for each of you to come work on the church grounds this weekend, at my farm. Tell your folks I said so. I’ll be coming around your houses this evening to make sure you told.”

The tone of Jacob’s voice had returned to normal. He came back from the place of inspiration from which he had just been speaking from. The boys noticed and respected his sincerity and the authority he commanded. They nodded in unison and turned down the road towards Oakwood Estates. Joseph followed them but the pastor stopped him.

“Joseph, wait just a minute, please.”

“Sir?”

“I don’t know your folks, I don’t believe. Do you live in Oakwood? Are you new to the area?”

“I live in the house on the hill, past the trailer park. We moved there a couple months ago.”

“The old Hight Farm house? I didn’t think that place was habitable anymore. Looks abandoned.”

“Yes sir. It needs work.”

“I suppose so. Don’t think anyone’s lived there for years.”

Jacob looked past the trailer park and saw the old farmhouse up on the rise.

“Well,” he said, “I’d like to introduce myself to your folks and tell them about what I saw today. I’d like to speak to your daddy. Do you mind if I walked with you home?”

“Yes sir. I mean, no sir. I don’t mind.”

Jacob smiled. He ruffled the hair on Joseph’s head. Joseph smiled back at him.

“You lead the way then.”

They both set off in the direction of the trailer park and the old farmhouse, not too far behind the other boys.



Chapter Two


A woman came to the screen door and was shocked to see her son standing there with a strange man in work clothes. She was dressed in a house dress and slippers, her hair held up above her neck in bobby pins. From within the smell of roast chicken and vegetables. Jacob nodded to her politely but Joseph would not make eye contact. She parted the door and motioned for Joseph to come to her side. He did so. Not wanting her to get the wrong impression, Jacob spoke first.

“Ma’am, I’m sorry to interrupt your day. I was wondering if I might speak to the boy’s father for just a moment. There was an incident on the road just now and Joseph-“

“I’m the boy’s mother and you may speak with me if you like. His father is not around, I’m afraid.”

Jacob frowned. He placed his hands deep in both pockets and looked at his shirt.

“Ma’am, already I feel like an utter fool. It was presumptuous of me to bypass your authority without understanding the situation. Please forgive me.”

Joseph’s mother opened the door further. She looked at the man and then at Joseph, trying to make sense of things. The low sunlight beamed across the porch onto her face. She shielded herself with one hand.

“I’m Beth. Beth Hight.”

“Jacob Brumbalow. Pastor in residence at New Calvary Baptist Church, right at the end of the road.”

“Oh yes, New Calvary. Of course I know the place. My co-worker Margaret goes there.”

“Margaret Foy?”

“That’s right.”

“A good family, the Foys.”

“She’s a sweet lady.”

“Yes ma’am.”

A moment of reflection on both parts and then their attention returned to Joseph. Beth opened the door and came out onto the porch. Joseph followed behind. His eyes never left the ground.

“Ma’am, about your son. I don’t want to keep you, but I felt compelled to let you know what happened.”

“Please do, Pastor. I hope nothing serious.”

“Well, I hate to say, but your son and a few other boys from Oakwood Estates were just now torturing a stray dog there on the road. I saw them from my farm while I was feeding my chickens. They had sticks and one of the boys had put one of those clip binders on its tail. Thing was spinning in circles trying to get it loose. It was in a lot of pain. That was clear.”

“Oh my goodness,” Beth said, turning to Joseph, “You were not raised like that, young man. We don’t torture animals. You are better than that. You hear me?”

Joseph did not answer. Beth was visibly upset and faced Jacob with an apologetic expression.

“Mr. Brumbalow, I am so sorry. I want to thank you for stopping them and for taking the time to walk up here and let me know. He  really is not like that. I don’t know what to say exactly.”

“Ma’am, please don’t feel you have to say anything. I will be honest. After speaking with Joseph I think this is just a case where he fell in with the wrong group of boys, unfortunately. Joseph has a good heart. He’s not like those other boys, Jesse Black and his gang. He has a heart that walks with God. Anybody can see that.”

Beth blushed at his uncommon sincerity. She pulled Joseph closer to her but he flinched and stood over by the porch railing.

“Thank you for saying that, Mr. Brumbalow.”

Jacob shrugged.

“Please call me Jacob.”

“Thank you, Mr. Jacob.”

Silence passed between them, and then she said, “May I get you something to drink before you take off? We have coffee and tea. Maybe some coke.”

“I never turn down a cup of coffee, especially on days like this. Not cold per se but if you stay outdoors long enough that chill gets inside your bones.”

“I know just what you mean. It’s colder than a witches titty around here lately. That’s what we say in Georgia.”

Joseph was embarrassed. Jacob laughed. Beth disappeared inside while Joseph and Jacob lingered on the porch. They did not speak.

Jacob admired the build of the house, a depression era architecture, simple wood frame, not much changed from its original materials. Much that was not painted was dry-rotted and what was painted was chipped and flaking off. The years of neglect were apparent. On the porch was a strange rocking chair with tire treads for rockers and a two-person swing that had fallen, a rusty single-gear bicycle, and some coffee tins that had been obviously been used for target practice a long time ago.

Beth called out from the kitchen, “How do you take it, Mr. Jacob?”

“Two sugars, no cream.”

A minute later Beth emerged with two mugs, steaming. She handed one to Jacob and set the other on a nearby window ceil. Turning to Joseph, who was not paying attention to their conversation anymore, “Why don’t you go mind Lizzie for awhile.”

Joseph nodded and headed indoors, but his mother stopped him.

“Tell Mr. Jacob you are sorry.”

Joseph went to Jacob and met his expectant eyes.

“I’m sorry for what I did.”

“You are forgiven, Mr. Joseph. I will see you bright and early tomorrow?”

“Tomorrow for what?” Beth asked.

“Forgive me again, Ms. Hight. We need some help to prepare for our Fall Festival upcoming and I figured some manual labor might do these boys some good. I’m sorry if I’m overstepping my boundaries.”

“Say no more. He’ll be there. Won’t you Joseph?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

Joseph went indoors, leaving Jacob and Beth on the porch. With him gone neither seemed sure where to take the conversation. Jacob studied the porch as if he were a carpenter. Beth watched him and nervously looked to see if Joseph was still in the kitchen, but he wasn’t.

“Boy I tell you-“ Jacob began.

“What’s that?”

“Well I was just going to say,” Jacob started again, not put off by the interjection, “They sure don’t build them like this anymore.”

“I guess not.”

“This is something else. Like looking at history. Like time travel. In this country our buildings are tore down and rebuilt so often its rare to see a place that’s been around like this one. This must be from the depression, at least.”

“I don’t really know. It looks it for sure.”

Jacob laughed, “Well, that’s to be expected. Would you mind if I took a walk around to check it out?”

“Well, okay. I’ll walk with you.”

The pastor stepped aside to allow Beth to descend the steps first and then followed, still admiring the porch framework.

They walked around the East side where a small shed sat close to the woods. There was an old Ford tractor half-covered with a canvas tarp under a makeshift work area. Jacob took off in that direction.

“Do you know what this is?”

“I don’t guess.”

“This is a Ford 9N. From the forties. Does it run?”

“I have no idea. My guess would be no.”

Jacob returned, glancing back at it. They continued around. He kept close to the house, admiring it, inspecting the little details. The wood around the base of the house was overgrown with lichens, clearly rotted away. The once white paint was cracked all over, dried into tiny shards that peeled off with your fingernail. The windows covered in a milky haze.

“Not sure why you’re so impressed with this place.”

Jacob stopped to consider her words and then replied, “I guess I’ve always been attracted to places like this. Abandoned factories, ruins of old towns, deserted Main Streets. You know? It seems a strange thing to love them. But I do. It makes me feel connected to the transience of all worldly things. In that way I feel closer to God.”

Beth had no reply. Jacob seemed embarrassed to have revealed it to her. They continued walking.

In the back of the house there was a small porch area with an iron table and chairs and some brick steps leading to the back entryway. But what stood out was a massive Water Oak tree that rested against the side of the house, collapsing the upper side where wall met roof. The tree was dried and rotted through. Clearly this had occurred years ago. A few small branches lay in a pile next to the tree, recently cut. Against the house was an ax.

“Would you look at that.”

“I guess you’re wondering why on Earth we’d move into a house in this condition?”

“Among other things,” said Jacob, ducking under the trunk and walking the length of the tree to the exposed roots, all tangles and clods of earth spiraling in a hundred different directions.

Beth joined him there and they both looked up the length of the tree where it spread into a fan of dead limbs and twigs, leaves. It almost seemed to be a part of the roof whose shingles were peeled off in places, as dry and old as the tree. From here you could see into the attic space where they tree had broken through, water-damaged cardboard boxes, a lamp stand, somebody’s old wig.

“Why do you live here?” Jacob asked.

“Necessity. This is my father-in-law’s farm. Ken Hight. He sold off this land in pieces throughout the sixties and seventies, then moved out all together in the late eighties. After my husband Will left for an oil field job in North Dakota last year and never came back, Mr. Hight became sick, so sick he couldn’t care for himself anymore. Water on the brain. You ever heard of that? There is a name for it, but I don’t remember-”

“Hydrocephalus,” Jacob said, “my uncle had that at one time. There is treatment though if I remember right.”

“If you are a reasonable person, sure. But I guess you haven’t met Mr. Ken Hight.” 

Beth laughed but there was no joy in her laughter. Jacob smiled kindly, his eyes drawn down. His hands clenched nervously together.

“I imagine that big gaping hole doesn’t help the insulation. Has it been cold for you this fall?”

“Like you wouldn’t believe. There is a wood stove in the kitchen that can warm the house okay. I think we’ll do alright through the winter. I hope we do. Mr. Hight has days where he is good and speaks clearly, has energy. He’ll take Joseph and cut firewood. We got a whole stockpile ready. And we’re making plans to patch the wall and roof.”

“Could at least get it covered with a tarp, something like.”

“That’s true. I wish we didn’t have to move here. It was the only place Mr. Ken still owned after his other place was lost to  foreclosure. We lost our place too. I just couldn’t make the bills with only my paycheck. Not with mouths to feed. Piggly Wiggly don’t pay cashiers those kind of wages.”

“Oh you work there, I like that old place. But I go to the Krogers most often now, since it opened up.”

He looked at Beth with a guilty expression.

“It is closer. I know how that is.”

Jacob nodded.

“So you live here with Mr. Hight and Joseph?”

“And Lizzie, my four year old. She’s a handful all by herself, let me tell you.”

“I bet. I know how that is.”

“How old are your kids?”

“Oh, I don’t have children. So far in life I am married to the church, as they say. Not that Southern Baptist Pastors can’t marry and have kids. We aren’t Catholic praise Jesus.”

“I see,” Beth giggled. She avoided continuing down that line of conversation and returned to the house, “So, we’re making it work, I guess. Doing the best with what we got.”

“Yes, ma’am. Jacob nodded. 

Beth tried not to make eye contact with him, her eyes wet. She rubbed them and then laughed again unexpectedly.

“I think we might have eavesdroppers.”

Jacob looked to where Beth was pointing and saw Joseph and a little girl staring out of a small window on the corner of the house. The girl waved. Joseph only watched.

“Is that Lizzie then?”

“That’s my little monster.”

“She’s a cutie.”

“Thank you.”

Beth waved back at them and then turned to the fence and a large field that went back for acres. She gestured to it and Jacob followed with his eyes.

“All of this was Hight Farm. And more. Hundreds of acres. If Mr. Ken hadn’t sold off this property there’s not telling how much it’d be worth nowadays the way the prices are shooting up. Now all that’s left is from here to that fence and then in front down to the trailer park. A good piece of land I suppose, but a lot of work to be done to get it back in shape.”

“That it is.”

Next to the roots was a small marker stone, faded and covered with dry dirt, grass high obscuring the words.

“Who is buried here?”

“That is Mr. Hight’s first wife. Ms. Carol. She died from breast cancer in nineteen sixty three. I always remember the year cause that’s when I was born. I’m sure it says on the marker there but its covered up with grass.”

Beth and Jacob continued around the house, stopping at a stone bird feeder filled with leaves. Admiring it, Jacob briefly caught a glimpse into the big window on that side, perhaps the den area where he saw an old man in a robe sitting on a recliner. The man was not doing anything. Not reading. Not watching television. Not even thinking the way it looked. Just staring into empty space. His gray hair was disheveled, his whiskers long and skin papery pale. Alone in the dim room.

When they came around again to the front Jacob did not walk onto the porch. He started towards the drive where a beat-up old jalopy sat uneven, one of the tires low. Olive green in color.

“Ms. Hight,” Jacob turned to her, “thank you for taking the time to talk with me today and for showing me your house. I don’t want to take up any more of your time.”

“Oh, its no bother. I like the company. And please call me Beth. I don’t deserve that formality.”

He smiled.

“Even so, ma’am. I mean Beth. Please tell Joseph to be at my place at eight am. Just behind the church there. I’m gonna go see about those other boys too, before it gets too dark.”

Beth nodded. Jacob did not quite know how to end the conversation gracefully, so he glanced over to the car and decided to make small talk about it.

“Chevy Vega. I haven’t seen one of these in years. Run good?”

“Don’t run at all, at the moment. You don’t know anything about cars do you? That’s my only transportation. Gave out a week ago. Been hitching rides to work since then.”

“I know a little bit,” Jacob admitted sheepishly, “Mind if I pop the hood?”

He opened the door and reached in to unlatch the hood, then walked over and propped it open. He leaned inside and did some quick diagnostic work, checked the fluids, belts, hoses.

“Mr. Ken looked and thought it might be the water pump. Whatever he thought was expensive, a few hundred dollars to fix and we don’t have that kind of money.”

“Yeah, water pump’ll run you. Might get a good deal at a junk yard though. Hard to tell right off. Does it run at all?”

“It starts but don’t run well, kind of sputters then dies. Overheats too. Crank it up if you want to. Keys should be in it.”

He got in and turned it over. It did start after a few attempts but the engine sounded weak, sick and once Jacob took his foot off the gas it died out. He tried a few more times with the same result.

“Hard to say what it is,” Jacob admitted, “But I tell you what Ms. Beth, I think I might be able to get it down to my place - got a work shelter there I can park it under, and my tools. I’d be happy to see what I can do.”

Beth lit up.

“You don’t have to do that, really.”

“Ma’am, I want to do it.”

“Well, thank you very much,” Beth said. She did not know what to say to that, “I can pay you something for your time.”

The pastor shook his head sternly and said with the utmost sincerity, “The opportunity to help another living soul is a gift from God above. I won’t accept your money, no ma’am.”

With some help from Joseph, who sat inside the car and pumped the gas and turned the ignition when Jacob gave the signal, they finally got the car started and in gear and eased it down the dirt driveway. The engine sputtered and jerked even taking it easy like he was, sounding like it might die at any moment. By the time it reached the trailer park it had sputtered out again.  Some neighbors poked their head out of small windows, watching him. Jacob popped the hood again and tinkered around and it started again. This happened twice more before he was on the road down to his place.

“What a decent man,” smiled Beth, who stood with arms crossed on the porch, Joseph and Lizzie beside her, watching him, “An uncommonly decent man, Jacob Brumbalow.”

Beth reached out to squeeze her son around the shoulder but he shirked away and opened the screen door, going inside without a word. Lizzie took his place beside their mother and their hands intertwined. Both watched as the pastor drove their car until it  disappeared beyond the row of trees that lined the drive to Oakwood Estates, then they too went inside.


Chapter Three


A morning wind blew through the tree tops and shook what few leaves remained in the oaks that enshrined Pastor Jacob’s farm house. The leaves fell in lazy arcs from those high places and landed next to the woodshed where Jacob and Joseph were standing. There were rakes and shovels, shears propped up against the shed. Every few seconds the pastor came out with another tool and handed it to Joseph whose job it was to arrange them outside. The last thing Jacob brought out was a bag of feed. He handed the burlap sack to Joseph, walked out of the shed, and closed the door.

Behind the Pastor Joseph followed until they reached the crude pen where all the chickens were. There was a mesh wire to keep them in and a small wooden shelter for them all to nest in at night, filled with straw. Jacob stepped over the fence and Joseph did the same. The chickens came swarming around, expectant, eager.

“My little angels,” the pastor said, “enjoy your breakfast.”

He took the bag of feed from Joseph and tossed handfuls of the corn feed. The chickens scattered at each toss in a panicked dash for the morsels. There were birds of every color. Brown, white, black. One had a limp, withered leg and Jacob tossed a handful specifically in close range to it.

“Suppose I could just get a feeder,” Jacob admitted to Joseph, “but I like to do it myself. It does a heart good to serve the small creatures of this world. Even them.”

Jacob’s gaze went to the horizon where the mountains were. He handed the bag to Joseph and asked him to spread a few more handfuls around, which he did.

“Do you think I speak strangely?” Jacob asked, “I know I do. Folks don’t normally talk like me. I’ve known that for a long time. I get a lot of strange looks from strangers. They think I carry a soapbox around with me.”

“I like the way you talk.”

Their eyes met and they smiled without saying anything else until the chickens were fed. After, they walked back to the shed and Jacob put up the feed and grabbed a handful of the tools. Joseph did the same and they walked up to the church, where by now the other boys were waiting for them.

“Well now, Jesse, Maurice, Ignacio, glad you could join us on this fine morning.”

The Oakwood Estate boys had been lounging on a stack of spare tires next to the garage. They rose when Jacob and Joseph appeared. None looked happy to be there.

“So what do you want us to do?”

“Now that doesn’t sound too enthusiastic, Jesse. We got a lot of work to do for Cornucopia. Mainly with the church. There’s kiosks and tents to set up, hay bales to arrange for the games and sitting areas, tables for the food vendors. And a few other things that escape me at the moment. We got a few days to take care of it all, but I want to get as much done as possible.”

Jesse and Maurice shuffled reluctantly towards the church. Ignacio was still half asleep, but when he saw Jacob and Joseph head that way he jumped to it and followed close behind. When they reached the church there was a red long-bed pickup truck loaded with bales of hay.

“Want you boys to start there. All them bales need to come down off that truck first thing. Then we need to arrange them according to Ms. Margaret’s diagram. I’ll go get that.”

Maurice heaved himself onto the truck bed and stood on a bale.

“Now wait a minute,” Jacob said, “Before we start the work today, I want you boys to reflect a minute on why you’re here the next few days.”

“Yes sir.”

“Jesse,” Jacob said, singling him out, “Why are you here today?”

“Cause that dog, I guess.”

“What about that dog, I guess?”

“Cause we was giving it a hard time I guess. Hell, I don’t know.”

The boys snickered. Jacob grew angry.

“Son, that ain’t a word we use around here. You watch that mouth or I’ll watch it for you, hear?”

“Sir.”

“Now what about that dog? Ignacio, what you got to say for yourself?”

“We treated that dog unkindly. That is not how we should treat animals who are our kin under God.”

“Amen to that. Thank you, Ignacio.”

Jacob pointed to the recreation area where there was a basketball goal and some tables set up.

“Set you boys up with some water over there on the table. And since its cold out, I had Ms. Margaret whip you up some cocoa. You just tell her when you’re ready for a cup. And that’s after you’ve unloaded this truck first. Got to get this thing back to Jeremy before the end of the day.”

They all stood around.

“Well, what you waiting for? Christmas? Hop to it.”

The boys started heaving bales of hay one after the other. Maurice and Ignacio were on the truck, while Jesse and Joseph caught them from below and started stacking them on the ground.

“Hold up, Joseph. I have another job for you, son. Follow me please.”

The other boys exchanged significant glances and from the corner of their eyes glared at Joseph, whom they felt was getting special treatment. Joseph felt their malice and rushed to catch up with Jacob who was headed back to his house.

Around the back of Jacob’s house there was a fenced in vegetable and flower garden. There were stone decorations, gnomes and bird feeders. The vegetation dried up from the season. All in all it was a nice garden.

“Pastor before grew this garden, set up all these statues and stuff. Thing is, I don’t have no use for it myself. And it just looks awful with no upkeep. My thumbs are missing the green if you know what I mean?”

Joseph had never heard the expression before so he just nodded.

“Anyway, I want you to work on tearing this thing out of here. By the time you’re through the whole twenty square foot area should be one big patch of dirt. Think you can handle that?”

“Where should I put the decorations?”

“Over there on the junk pile. I’ll break em up with the sledgehammer later, unless I can talk you into doing that too.”

“Can I?”

Jacob grinned.

“I thought you might be into something like that. I set that sledge over by the shed. Just put it back when you’re done.”

“Where should I put all the plants and vegetable stalks, weeds.”

“Anything you tear out of the ground just put over there in the burn pile. I’m gonna rake some leaves this afternoon once I get through fixing your mom’s car. I’ll burn everything this evening in the bonfire. We’ll have some hot dogs ready at lunchtime too.”

“Okay.”

“Be sure and take a break every now and then.”

“Yes, sir.”

Once Jacob was gone Joseph took a moment to survey the work to be done. Across the yard he saw the other boys working and cutting up. A part of him wanted to join in with them. He wasn’t sure why Jacob had given him to this job, but he was determined to do it well. So he set to work.

He figured the best way to approach it would be to first empty the garden of all the decorations and stone statues. So he picked the largest one, an obnoxious looking stone garden gnome, and hefted up on one shoulder and took it to the junk pile over by the garage. After that he grabbed them all, one by one, the bird feeder, the cherubs, the boy sitting on a bench. Then he grabbed the stained glass flowers, red, purple, orange. There was a faded nylon kite of a butterfly and he took that too. All in all it took a good forty five minutes to get everything non-green onto the junk pile.

Sweating and dirty he stopped for a quick break. Thought about grabbing a cold cup of water but didn’t feel like encountering the other boys at the moment. 

It felt good to work this way. To use his body and strength to some good purpose. Like how it ought to be.

He walked to the shed to grab the sledge hammer, a ten pounder that was well worn. He grasped the polished wooden handle with both arms and heaved the metal head over his shoulders and brought it down with all his force onto the garden gnome. It shattered into a dozen pieces of various sizes. Joseph felt the thrill of it. He continued to smash everything that was smash able and by the end of it there lay a patch of rubble at his feet.

Now it was time to start clearing the green things. Again he decided to start with the largest and work his way down. That seemed the most logical way to do it. Jacob had set a pair of work gloves out with the rest of the tools that day and he donned them now to make his work easier. Already he had a few blisters from the sledge.

He began by pulling up all the plants and small trees which lined the garden. At first it was easy to grab ahold at the base and lift with his back. But fatigue set in quick and it became harder and harder. He kept going though and soon the area around the fence was all cleared away, the remains lay in a pile nearby. 

Joseph took another break. He saw there was nobody at the table with the water cooler. Those other boys he heard on the other side of the church. They must be laying out those hay bales. Quickly he went over to it and filled the paper cup set out for them. He drank the water down and felt his energy return. Then he drank another three cups before his thirst was quenched.

He grabbed the long machete that lay next to the sledge hammer by the shed and commenced to attack the high weeds and tomato plant vines. He swung the blade like some primitive being. Fun was not the right word to describe it, but it was close. More like ecstasy. A meditative destruction. There was a rhythm to it and once he was in tune with it the time passed like water.

Before he knew it the garden was clear, at least from a few inches up. There was still the knee-work of pulling roots. He stopped with the machete and carried all the brush and weeds over to the burn pile, which was already large, stacked with busted wooden furniture, piles of leaves, shredded office documents. There was even an old doll in there burned up.

For the last bit of work he got down on his knees and set to pulling up the small rooted vegetable stalks, weeds sprouted from neglect. As he pulled the dark earth tilled and he could smell the life in the dirt, the decayed organics, fertile. 

It took awhile to pull the roots. There were some rocks set purposefully in places and he lifted them up to expose the worms and bugs. He brushed them off the rock and heaved them over the fence. A game he played was to see how close he could get one rock to the previous.

By this point he was famished and cold, his back aching. He thought it might be close to lunch time but had no way to tell the time. Not much left to do here. Once the roots were pulled the area could use a good raking and it would be just as Jacob had asked him. Lost in this idea he sat back on his feet and looked towards the garage. His mother’s Vega was there, up on two hydraulic jacks. He saw the pastor’s legs poking out. He then thought of his mother and Jacob walking together from the day before. His blood boiled at the thought. Why he asked. Why did they walk together?

A large flat stone at the far corner of the garden was the hardest one to lift. He hovered it and lift up from the bottom with both hands. As it flopped over he discovered underneath a nest of black widows and fell backwards on his hands to get away. They scattered to the darkest region, a shadowed area underneath the stone. A large one whose bulbous abdomen was as large as a penny, and maybe a dozen tiny ones. Joseph cautiously approached and studied them in horror.

He grabbed a stick and prodded at the edge of their hiding place. The large one reared up and waved its two front legs. The smaller ones kept in packs behind the large one. He thought about going to fetch Jacob but didn’t. He imagined them stirring in the darkness and the damp soil. A wave of revolt went through  him, disgusted by their ugliness. He wanted to get as far away as he could. He wanted to destroy them.

But instead he rose to his feet and from the shed he found a large snow shovel, with a wide scoop. He carried it over to the family of spiders and dug in underneath them. Carefully he pulled up a deep clod of the earth. The spiders were nearly undisturbed. He walked the shovel over behind the shed and dumped it with a quick downward shake. Then he returned to the garden. 

When Joseph was sure there were no more he flipped the flat stone onto its side and rolled it outside the fence area. When he got back checked his feet to make sure no stray spider had made it up his leg.

Afterwards he made his way over to the recreation area where Ms. Margaret had set out a few paper plates with some hot dogs under tin foil, then another plate with chopped onions, and two bottles of mustard and ketchup. A bag of Lays too.

Joseph bit into a hot dog and realized how wore out he really was. He could literally feel the energy return to his shoulders and arms. He scarfed down the rest in two more bites and made another. Then he sat down against the side of the brick building and rested. He took his time with the second dog, savoring its salty greasiness that contrasted nicely with a sprinkle of chopped onions and a dollop of mustard.

As he finished the other boys wandered up and helped themselves to the lunch. They were covered in sweat and grime. Bits of hay clung to their clothes, and bands of sweat soaked through their shirts at the collar and pits. They did not look happy to be there.

Joseph watched them, wanting to make conversation, but not sure where to start. Instead he went over and sat against the brick wall of the building. He bowed his head against his knees and closed his eyes, resting.

Jesse, Maurice, and Ignacio joked with one another and chatted about the usual things. Cars they would like to have one day, the store where the Indian owner would sell cigarettes to minors, girls who were easy. Joseph was comfortable when they talked about those things because the attention was not on him and he preferred it that way. But then a lull came.

Something pinged against his left leg. Then another. He lifted his eyes and saw pieces of onions on the ground. Then another hit him in the forehead. He looked up and glared. Maurice was close to him with a handful.

“Stop that.”

“Just making sure you ain’t asleep,” Maurice said. His laughter turned to anger, “some of us got to work today.”

“Some of us working our ass off while others get to kick back and relax,” Jesse added.

“I been working. I been working all morning. Look at my hands.”

“What you been doing?”

“Tearing out the garden at Jacob’s farm.”

“Bullshit,” Jesse said, “Show me.”

Jesse rose from the table and walked towards Joseph.

“I don’t got to show you nothing.” 

Joseph spit his words.

“You don’t want to show cause you ain’t been doing nothing.”

Jesse walked closer and did not stop until he was right at his feet. He then kicked them hard and mashed his toe into the concrete. Joseph squirmed free and rose He stared square at Jesse.

“Why don’t you cut it out, Jesse?”

“What you gonna do about it? Bastard boy.”

Joseph flinched at the insult even though he tried to not show it. His eyes watered at the corners.

“That’s what Pastor Jacob told us. Said your daddy was sorry. Left yall. And now he ain’t never coming back. What he said.”

“Fuck you. You fucking liar.”

“Ain’t that what he said?” Jesse turned to his friends.

“He said you daddy left and no come back no more.” 

Ignacio made like he was crying and wiped his eyes, and the others laughed.

“Now you’re just a bastard,” Jesse repeated, and with emphasis, “Boy.”

He then shoved Joseph in the chest with both hands at full force and the smaller one fell back against the brick wall and banged his head. He saw black then white and felt a cold sting on the back side of his head.

“Come on you fuckin bastard! You come at me and I’ll kick your sorry ass up and down the churchyard.”

Jesse was red in the face. His eyes fierce. Joseph had a very serious look on his face, but it was not anger. Jesse raised his hands in front of his face like a boxer, his fists clenched and bowed up. Joseph heard him muttered “bastard boy” under his breath, over and over again.

“Quit saying that.”

“Fucking bastard boy. I hate your goddamn guts. You just a little pussy and I can’t stand pussies.”

There was a brief moment as Joseph swung that he seemed to be watching himself from the outside, disconnected from the trouble, just observing, but the pain of that first contact with Jesse’s jaw brought him back to his body. And then he swung again. And again.

Jesse shielded himself from each subsequent blow, only the first one really connecting, but it did burst his lip and there were now a few droplets of blood on the basketball court at their feet.

Maurice and Ignacio circled around them and watched but the two others were oblivious, each boy locked into his rage. 

Jesse was taller and stronger so when he took his first swing it connected hard against Joseph’s jaw. He felt a piercing jolt and a tooth inside came loose in his mouth. He fell back on one hand and covered his face with the other. Jesse fell down on top of him. They rolled over and over, each boy fighting to be the one on top. Joseph grabbed the back of Jesse’s jacket and tried to pull it off and the arm tore in a single loud rip. Each one uttered obscenity after obscenity at the other.

Joseph had never felt so much hatred for anything in his life. If he had had the strength he would have killed Jesse Black for sure. Jesse connected one time in Joseph’s right eye and grazed his forehead. A red rash immediately appeared and his eye closed in pain.

They ended up on the ground. Their feet thrashed for traction and slung mud everywhere. Their jeans were covered in grass stains and mud. At that point Joseph turned the wrong way and Jesse caught a hold of him from behind, with one arm pulled against his back. He immediately stopped the struggle and collapsed in pain. Jesse knew he could break the arm with this leverage. He inched the arm up his back and felt Joseph shrivel each time.

“My arm. Let go of my fucking arm,” Joseph pleaded.

“Tell me you’re a bastard boy!”

“I ain’t saying that.”

Jesse inched up his arm a bit more and Joseph screamed.

“Say it now!”

Again he pushed the arm. This time the agony was too much for Joseph to bear.

“Bastard boy. Bastard boy.”

“Who’s a bastard boy?”

“Me,” Joseph submitted, “Now let me go. I’m the bastard boy. Me.”

Jesse released him with a final angry shove. Joseph caught himself and looked to make sure Jesse wasn’t going to attack again. But when Jesse looked at his jacket and jeans, Joseph was overcome with the dark anger. He saw his vision darken and charged at unsuspecting Jesse and tackled him into the mud. This time Jesse used his strength to roll over on top of Joseph and got one knee against his throat. Joseph flailed his arms helplessly while Jesse beat his head into the ground. Joseph tried to breathe in but couldn’t draw in enough air. He gasped and tried to push Jesse off but Jesse was too heavy and much too strong.

A hand from above grabbed Jesse by the collar of his jacket and swung him roughly to one side. Then he got between them both, his arms stretched in both directions. Each boy watched the other through the pastor, though neither would attempt to restart the fight now. Slowly their heart rates returned to normal and they felt around for the wounds on their faces and arms.

Joseph looked at Jacob and saw tears in reddened eyes. He felt a deep shame like he was sinking into a bottomless pit of mud. He wanted to escape into its darkness and stay there forever. Jacob said nothing to any of them except for once when he whispered, “Why don’t they understand?” to no one specific.

After some time Jacob told Maurice and Ignacio to return to the front of the church to finish up laying out the hay bales and start helping with the apples. Then he took Jesse inside to have Ms. Margaret tend to the cuts on his face and lip. When he emerged out carried a first aid kit and a bottle of Bactine.

Jacob then knelt in front of Will and dressed the cuts on his neck and forehead. There were other bruises on his face and arms but there was nothing to be done about those. Joseph accepted the pain of the antiseptic as punishment and wanted very badly for Jacob to look at him or say something to him, but he never did. When he finished he turned immediately to head back inside, but turned half around and spoke at him, but not to him.

“Go ahead and clean up the garden area, what you finished. Rake up them leaves and loose dirt, put it in the pile. After that head on back home for the day.”

Then he walked inside.

Joseph shuffled back to the garden and mechanically went to work. But there was no joy in it like there was before. He started crying and hid behind the wall in case anyone walked by and saw him. All the bottled up emotions poured out of him. He sobbed into his hands like he had not done since he was a baby. There was a darkness in his heart, the bottomless pit of mud. Every time he moved he felt a guilt sucking the energy from his limbs.

When the garden was raked and cleaned he put up all the tools and carried the remaining weeds and twigs over to the burn pile. Standing at the edge was Pastor Jacob. He had lit the pile with a gallon of gasoline and it was just now lighting up. In the fading light of the afternoon it was beautiful to see.

Joseph went over and threw the rest of the weeds into the pile. They immediately smoked and caught aflame. The smaller ones curled up into ashen embers almost right away.

He went and stood beside the Pastor Jacob who still had not spoken to him. They both watched the fire burn in silence. Its flames whipped against the cold wind. Heat radiated outward and warmed their faces and bathed them in an amber glow.

“I feel like a failure,” Jacob said at last. It was completely unlike what Joseph had been expecting, so much so that he didn’t know what to say.

“It was me who failed,” Joseph said.

In silence they continued to watch the fire burn. The fire grew so large they had to stand back and Joseph felt he heat on his face and simultaneously the cold of the evening on his back.

It was that time of day when the shapes of things become indistinct and fade into shadows or even disappear. Joseph stared into the fire one moment and the next he was on the road to his house. He wasn’t sure Jacob even saw him go. Before leaving the yard he looked back and saw the pastor’s silhouette against the leaping flames, silent and rigid.

Joseph zipped up and thrust his hands in his coat pockets but the cold quickly penetrated his jacket’s thin material. He was shivering. There was a wind that blew through the limbs in the trees above. Against his face it was like a sting. He hurried up the road halfway between a walk and a jog. When he came to the entryway to Oakwood Estates he looked inside all the trailers to the warmth within. Now up the hill he could see the farm house and the lights from the living room window a beacon to him in the darkness.

As he came to the front porch his gait slowed and instead of going straight in he went over to the living room window and peered in. There was his mother and Lizzie reading Curious George out loud on the couch. Grandpa was there too, on the recliner listening. None of them saw him, so he continued to watch. Mother turned the page and Lizzie grew excited and shouted something and raised her arms like a monkey and grandpa erupted into a spontaneous fit of laughter.

In that moment Joseph felt far away from them. It was like five hundred years had passed since this morning; it was like he had walked around the Earth for seven years. He didn’t fully grasp what he was feeling at that moment but he had understood something for the first time in his life. Tears welled in his eyes. He understood that a moment in time was not something he could ever possess, and yet he felt a strong desire to possess this moment — to keep it with him always. He took his hands out of his coat pocket and pressed one of his palms against the cold window. That caught Lizzie’s attention and she jumped from her mother’s lap and raced over to place her hand over his, laughing. Only a pane of glass was between them.


Chapter Four


They were late so Beth handed Joseph the keys to the car and asked him to go warm it up.

“How do I do it?”

“You put the key in the switch, crank it up, and let it run.”

“Do I press any pedals?”

“Do not press any pedals.”

“Okay.”

“Or touch the steering wheel. Just key, switch, turn.”

“Yes ma’am.”

“And turn the heater on.”

Joseph already had on his good clothes and ran out the door. He had never been entrusted to start the car before. The seats were icy cold, the vinyl hard. He carefully put the key his mother handed him (not any of the others) into the switch and turned it. The engine turned over then died. He remembered his mother usually pumped the gas a few times but was forbidden to do that, so he tried again this time holding the ignition so it kept turning over. After a few sections the engine rumbled and went into idle. He turned on the heater and went back inside to wait on everybody.

Beth asked Grandpa Ken if he’d like to go to the Cornucopia Festival one more time, and getting the expected answer of no, round up Lizzie and her doll, picked up her purse and an apple pie she made, and they all headed out the door.

The car pulled down the drive and made it just past the entrance to Oakwood Estates when it started to rattle like something was loose in the engine compartment and then shut off completely. It rolled to a stop and Beth tried to force the wheel over but it wouldn’t budge.

Lizzie looked around confused. Beth tried to restart the ignition but it didn’t even try to turn over. Joseph watched his mother.

“Why did we stop?”

“Quiet, Lizzie,” Joseph said.

“Baby, hold on a minute.”

After it was clear the car was not going to start, Beth considered their options. She looked up the hill, then down the road. Either way it was a good walk, especially in this weather. After the sun went down the temperature dropped below freezing. Single digits coming sometime in the night. They had signs at the trailer park that told people to leave their faucets dripping.

Beth zipped up her coat and made sure Lizzie had on her coat. She did. But her mittens they had left in the rush.

“Do you have your gloves?”

“No ma’am.”

Beth was upset but she tried not to show it.

“Do you want to run back up to the house and fetch your gloves and Lizzie’s mittens?”

Joseph nodded and started to get out.

“No, nevermind. Don’t do that.”

Joseph stopped, awaiting direction.

“Let’s just try to get this car off the road a bit. It’s kind of in a dangerous spot. A car not paying attention could run into it.”

“Okay.”

“Look here. Climb out and get in the back. When I yell start pushin. I’m going to put it in neutral and steer.”

“Yes ma’am.”

“Push hard.”

“Alright.”

Joseph got out and went behind the car. The metal body was so cold he could feel his hands try to stick to it. Beth put the car in neutral and shouted for Joseph to push. Joseph dug his feet into the dirt road and heaved his entire weight against the trunk, but he only succeeded in rocking against the wore-out shocks. It bounced a few times but didn’t budge.

“Ain’t going no where.”

“I can see that.”

“What should we do now?”

Beth got out of the car and walked back to where Joseph stood.

“Here, why don’t you get in and steer us onto the side of the road, this way.”

She made a gesture like turning the wheel to the right ever so slightly. Joseph nodded and got in. He put both hands on the wheel to guide it. He saw his mother in the side mirror lean into the trunk with all her strength. Puffs of her breath floated into the night air as she groaned. It started to move.

“It’s going, mama!”

“I see that baby,” Beth said, her voice straining, “now steer us to the side of the road.”

“Okay.”

The car gained momentum and it wasn’t long before they were on the grass. But there was a frozen mud puddle and just as they got to a good place Beth slipped on it and fell on her knees. The bottom of the dress was soaked. She rose and cursed, then walked angrily to the driver’s door.

“Scootch over.”

Joseph slid into the passenger seat. Beth got in and put the car in park, turned on the emergency lights. She turned on the dome light and looked at her dress.

“Knew I shouldn’t have worn this thing. Now look at it.”

“Ain’t your fault, mama,” Joseph said.

“Well,” Beth sighed, “do you guys want to try to go to the fall festival, or go back to the house?”

“Festival!” Lizzie shouted.

Joseph wanted to go to the festival, but he knew his mother probably didn’t now. He kept quiet.

“Let’s go then,” Beth said.

It was about three quarters of a mile to New Calvary from where the Vega broke down. Beth took Lizzie out of her car seat and set her down. Joseph zipped up his coat and put his hands in his pocket. They started walking.

The sky was clear and the stars were out, shining brightly. Lizzie gazed up at them as they walked together. Then she got tired and asked for her mother to hold her, so Beth picked her up and continued. Joseph walked along the edge of the woods and breathed in rhythms that he thought sounded like a train.

In the distance they could see car lights in the church parking lot and more lights beyond the tree line of colors orange, yellow, and green. There was some kind of music playing but they were too far to place it.

“I sure hope they have apple cider,” Joseph said.

“Hot apple cider,” Beth added.

“I’ll have a gallon.”

They laughed and quickened their pace. 

By now they were starting to see people. Families walking together in the light. A tractor was pulling up with a load of kids in the back. The hay ride.

“Can we do the hay ride mama?” Joseph asked.

“If you want, baby.”

“Mama, I don’t want to do the hay ride.” Lizzie said.

“Me neither hon. We’ll leave that to the boys, what do you say?”

“It’s too cold out here!”

“That’s right.”

As they came up to the end of the road they saw a large paper banner that had been strung across two trees at the turn. It said, “Welcome to the Cornucopia”. They passed under it as they headed towards the main entrance of the big building. There must have been a hundred or so people there from the looks of it, both congregation and those just out for the entertainment.

They didn’t know anyone at New Calvary, but the people seemed friendly, walking around together with red faces in their puffy jackets and coats, carrying cups of steaming coffee and cider.

The music they had heard from the road was a live bluegrass band playing on a small stage set up in the basketball court area. On the stage was a large cornucopia made of straw and filled with flowers and dried ears of corn. The bands was playing a song that Joseph liked, something you might call foot-stomping. A few couples danced in front of the band. One of the banjo players took a break and blew into his hands for warmth. 

The family went inside and were greeting by two elderly women in matching sweaters with black cats on them. Good food lined the buffet table. Traditional southern fare. They were told to help themselves. Joseph dished himself a slab of ham, mac and cheese, turnip greens and two dinner rolls with butter. To go with that he poured a cup of steaming apple cider. They sat at one of the empty plastic tables that had been set up in the open space.

Everyone who passed by smiled at them. Lizzie waved at total strangers and tried to talk to the little kids who walked by, but they were too afraid to talk back. It was warm inside. There was a tall fireplace at the far corner burning bright. A stack of fuel logs were piled up in a stand next to it.

“This food is delicious!” Beth said. She made eye contact with the of the women at the door and indicated she approved of the food. The ladies nodded and smiled.

“Mama, I want to look at the horsies.”

“We’ll go out there in a minute, hon. Let mama finish her food.”

A young couple then approached their table. They were attractive, dressed a little nicer than everyone else, and acted somewhat ashamed of their boldness. The woman spoke first.

“Sorry to bother y’all. By any chance are you Beth Hight and family?”

Beth held out her hand. She shook hands with the woman and then the man.

“Well, yes we are. I’m Beth and this is my son Joseph and my daughter Lizzie.”

Lizzie waved to them and Joseph nodded. The woman and man both beamed and exchanged glances.

“Pastor Jacob told us all about y’all. Said y’all might be coming tonight. We just wanted to stop by and introduce ourselves. My name is Kelly and this is my husband Steven. We’re the Echols. Steven is the youth pastor here at New Calvary and I work in the office part time. We live just down the road.”

“Well, that’s awfully nice of you to come by. I didn’t know Jacob was going to make a fuss. He just invited us the other day you know.”

“Oh its no fuss. We’re just like that around here. Gossip spreads like wild fire. Jacob can’t stop talking about meeting you and Joseph and your house on the hill.”

She laughed in a charming way and pushed the hair off her shoulders. Steven leaned in close to Lizzie and spoke to her in a small voice.

“Ms. Lizzie, have you ever tried bowling with a pumpkin?”

“Bowling with a pumpkin?”

“That’s right. And if you knock down all the pins you can win a prize!”

Lizzie turned to her mother.

“I know darlin, we can go pumpkin bowling. Hold on just a minute.”

“Oh, no, what did you do Steven?”

“I just couldn’t help myself.”

Everyone laughed. Joseph and Beth got up. Beth handed Joseph the plates to throw away which he did in the nearest container. Beth wiped the crumbs from her lap drawing attention to her stained dress. Kelly gasped.

“Oh my dear Lord, what happened to your dress?”

“Our car broken down on the drive over. It was dark and I slipped in a mud puddle. Not a big deal.”

“Well we need to treat it while its still fresh. Let’s go to the wash room.”

Beth looked confused but Kelly place her hand on her shoulder to assure her.

“It’s no trouble at all, darlin. Won’t take but a minute. Just follow me.”

Joseph took Lizzie’s hand and they all went together through a hallway to the back of the building. The lights were off but she switched them on as they walked through the rooms. They came to a small laundry area, which surprised Beth to see in a church building, but she didn’t say anything.

“The only reason I insist is I had a dress that stained in the mud last year and I like to never forgave myself for not treating it right off. That thing never looked the same again.”

“You’re probably right.”

Kelly looked in the cabinets over the washing machine and pulled out a green bottle of Clorox treatment solution. She knelt at Beth’s feet and took a scrub brush that lay on the ground and lightly patted the area while spritzing with the treatment. Joseph and Lizzie wandered in place, looking at the office equipment.

“Y’all stay close. Don’t touch anything, you hear me?”

“Yes, ma’am.”

After a minute of treatment the stain was noticeably less intense. Kelly rose. She looked proud of herself.

“There are you, ma’am. I think that’ll do it. Next time you put that thing in the wash the rest of the stain is gonna come right out.”

“You are an angel,” Beth said, “thank you so much.”

“I just consider it atonement for my own dress.”

“Okay,” Steven said, “I’ve think we’ve had enough boring old housekeeping. Let’s go have some fun.”

“Yeah!” Lizzie and Joseph both agreed.

In the front of the building, facing the main road were several games set up. There was ring toss where you tried to loop a metal ring over some set up milk bottles, guess the number of dry pinto beans in a glass jug, and over on the end pumpkin bowling, where you got to pick your pumpkin and try to knock over five bowling pins. The alley was formed from bales of hay.

Steven picked up a tiny pumpkin and handed it to Lizzie. She admired it and carefully stepped up to the alley. With both hands she threw the pumpkin overhead and it went over the hay bales into the ring toss area, knocking over some milk jugs.

Steven and Joseph started laughing. Beth gasped and put her hand over her mouth. Kelly shouted, “Oh, no!” The boy tending the game gave an annoyed glare and tossed the pumpkin back to Steven.

“Thanks, Kenneth. Sorry about that.”

“Did I win it?” Lizzie asked.

“No,” Steven said, “I’m afraid not yet. Do you want to try again?”

“I want Joseph to do it now. It’s his turn.”

Joseph took a turn and being a game designed for kids he easily knocked over the pins. Still, everyone cheered for him. The girl tending the game handed Joseph a small pumpkin with a smiley face painted on it as a prize. He handed it to Lizzie who was ecstatic to receive it.

“Oh,” Kelly said, turning to them as if she had just remembered something, “you have to try Ms. Margaret’s ginger bread. You never had anything like it in your life. Come on.”

Each one of them got a small slice of the gingerbread on a paper plate and a Dixie up of hot cider to go with it. The cake was moist and spicy, kept warm in the heating tray. They all agreed it was much better than they expected it to be. Kelly looked proud.

“I wouldn’t lie to y’all, was that not the best thing you ever tasted?”

“It was really good.” Joseph agreed.

While drinking the cider and having a couple more pieces of the gingerbread they talked about the church and Pastor Jacob, and Steven was in the middle of a story about the time Jacob tried to bake an apple pie for a fundraiser when a hand clasped onto his shoulder from behind.

“What’s that now, Steven? My ears were burning over there so I had to come over.”

Steven turned red. Everyone else laughed.

“Now brother Jacob, you know I wouldn’t talk bad about your cooking.”

“I suppose not. That apple pie was the best door stopper we ever had around here. Ain’t that right, sweet pea?”

Jacob leaned over and poked Lizzie in the belly, who laughed even though she didn’t get the joke. He rose and greeted Joseph with a hand extended.

“Nice of you to make it, Mr. Hight.”

Joseph smiled big and shook his hand.

“Yes, sir.”

He then turned to Beth and gave her a hug.

“Miss Beth, so happy you could make it to our little festival. Have you had any of Miss Margaret’s gingerbread yet?”

“Oh yes, Kelly brought us over here.”

They stood around and talked and then the band got back on stage after taking a short break. The erupted into a lively song that got a few young couples out on the dance area. Steven extended his arm to Kelly and she winked and they took off to the floor and joined the others. They were very good dancers. Then Jacob extended his arm to Beth who looked taken aback. She even blushed a little but smiled. She took his arm and they hopped off to the dance floor. When Steve and Kelly saw them they clapped and made a space for them to join in.

Joseph and Beth watched from the games area, hand in hand. Jacob led her in the dance and was graceful on his feet as well. He spun their mother and dipped her at one point. Beth laughed. It had been a long time since he saw his mother so happy. He was happy too.

When the song was over they returned to where Joseph and Lizzie were and rested. The band started playing another song but they all agreed one song was enough.

Jacob noticed the stain on Beth’s dress and remarked to her.

“Did we just do that out there?”

Beth blushed and seemed reluctant to tell him how it happened, but then Kelly broke in.

“Their dang car broke down on the way over here tonight, would you believe that? Luckily they don’t live far.”

Jacob’s expression darkened and his light-hearted mood faded. They all saw him turn and became concerned themselves.

“What’s wrong, pastor?” Steven asked.

“Mr. Jacob thankfully fixed my car problem the other day,” Beth said, “I think something else is wrong with it now.”
