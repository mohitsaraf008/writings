JOSEPH THE SON by Daniel Stepp

Joseph was used to the darkness by now, finding his way in the darkness, without the use of his eyes. In the night a snow had come and blanketed the field behind the old barn. It was morning now and yet still dark. The family asleep in the house. The hogs asleep in the barn. They two the only ones awake. The boy followed behind his grandfather and tried to match the footprints his boots left in the powder. Joseph in his winter coat, a scrap of shirt wrapped around his mouth and nose. He breathed through the material and felt his hot breath mingle with the cold air. He carried a hammer and some pegs. Soon they came to the broken fence at the edge of the field. Beyond the field the woods. Grandfather in  his pajamas and a wool coat, ragged with holes.



...and gazed long past the fallen limbs and briars into the woods beyond the field, where he was not allowed to go.



An unfamiliar figure emerged over the hill and approached the house. Joseph and his brother watched from the porch.

A familiar figure.
