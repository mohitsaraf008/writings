Sketches about a particular day in a modern office environment

A man who has a dream in the morning of the universe and for the first time in 
his life is sure that God must exist. And then his day starts and slowly his 
meditative state gives way to daily stresses. The sketch ends with the line, 
"...that bitch Shannon."

A man who plays games to amuse himself at work decides to spend the day telling 
no lies or fabrications. He ends up quitting in the middle of meeting and finally 
ends up at a park in the city with a homeless man.

A manager who loses his job because of an inappropriate act of compassion that
violates company protocol.
