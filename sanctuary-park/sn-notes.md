Stories about goodness in an office setting

A story about a manager of a software company who stands up for an abused employee 
and is forced out of his position because of it, replaced by someone with more of 
a 'just get it done' mentality. But the story is not told head-on, its told through 
a series of ten short stories taking place around the time of the event, each one 
about a different employee under the manager. The stories are titled with the name 
of the main character in them.

Mark Cagill - A tech support worker who fills the mundanity of his jobs with little 
games to amuse himself, like not speaking one day, and on the day of the story 
by telling everyone the absolute truth. He does this on a support call and makes 
the caller irate, gets in trouble with management and leaves. In the city he picks 
up a man needing a ride who proceeds to tell him a bullshit story about how his 
mother is in the hospital and he needs a ride there, money. In the end they end up 
in the city park watching the stars and the con artist tells him, 'I never knew my 
dad'.

It started last year, around Christmas. The bigwigs decided all tech support had to be available for oncall through the holidays. We had just launched a public beta and it was vital to make a good impression during these crucial blah blah. I was pissed. You know, before that I actually gave a damn at work. Not a hundred percent of a damn, but seventy, maybe eighty percent, sure. I really did. But after that, after they shattered my youthful naïveté, I tuned out. [pretends to be sick]

Oncall doesn't even make sense, they're just afraid and covering their ass. Well fuck them.


Elizabeth Rogers - A receptionist who has a crush on a man who works in the next 
building, for Microsoft. There is a makeshift path around a small lake and they 
both walk there, together but in silence. It is the highlight of her day to see him 
there and exchange glances, just be together in the same physical space. And her 
heart is broken one day when he finally speaks to her, because the promise of what 
could be is gone.


Ponce - offends a woman at toys r us in line, spends the rest of the story trying to find her, sees her but doesn't say anything. This is character who is ousted for refusing to fire Janice.


The interview candidate has a criminal background, nobody wants to work with him. A debate, the woman wants to give him a chance but is powerless.

That's 4 stories, if you can think of six more, then interleave those with epistolatory sections, official emails, memos, you might have a good novel.

She didn't particularly want to write it. What if she refused, like Ponce did?


I have always liked the time of year when the leaves have already fallen and 
freezing gusts of wind blows through the branches of the maple trees in the yard. 
I have always like to bundle up against the cold, to keep warm, as they say. But 
for some reason I can never admit that to anybody. I feel compelled somehow to pretend 
my favorite season is the summer or the spring time, whenever I'm asked. But, the thing 
is, nobody cares. I know they don't. It's completely stupid this need I feel to project 
an image of myself that I think others want me to be. I think its because I'm a woman 
and a woman is supposed to like pretty things and that does not include the dead of 
winter. She is supposed to like the beach and flowers and warm sunshine. But I don't. 
Well, I do like them too, sure. But the happy times of the year don't stir my soul in 
the same way. They never have. So I pretend and keep it to myself. Though, I did 
tell somebody once.

[all the little moments that led up to talking to her future husband, you learn 
at the end she has been reminiscing from a nursing home]

Ponce inability to be forgiven leads to refusing to fire Jim, which makes him not go through with it.

Girl realized why she cried looking out of the window of a nursing home.
