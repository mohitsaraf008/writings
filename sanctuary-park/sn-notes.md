A story about a manager of a software company who stands up for an abused employee 
and is forced out of his position because of it, replaced by someone with more of 
a 'just get it done' mentality. But the story is not told head-on, its told through 
a series of ten short stories taking place around the time of the event, each one 
about a different employee under the manager. The stories are titled with the name 
of the main character in them.

Mark Cagill - A tech support worker who fills the mundanity of his jobs with little 
games to amuse himself, like not speaking one day, and on the day of the story 
by telling everyone the absolute truth. He does this on a support call and makes 
the caller irate, gets in trouble with management and leaves. In the city he picks 
up a man needing a ride who proceeds to tell him a bullshit story about how his 
mother is in the hospital and he needs a ride there, money. In the end they end up 
in the city park watching the stars and the con artist tells him, 'I never knew my 
mother'.

Elizabeth Rogers - A receptionist who has a crush on a man who works in the next 
building, for Microsoft. There is a makeshift path around a small lake and they 
both walk there, together but in silence. It is the highlight of her day to see him 
there and exchange glances, just be together in the same physical space. And her 
heart is broken one day when he finally speaks to her, because the promise of what 
could be is gone.
