Notes for The Song


A man working for a technology company has an idea and fights to get it into the product, but is ostracized, and eventually fired.
He starts his own company and sees the new idea come to fruition, success, then corruption by those who misunderstand the spirit of it.

A story about the lifecycle of a new idea. Very spare, minimal - showing the world of corporate tech vs startup. Minimal but specific to a world. A new way of communicating via an amalgam of words/video/voice into something like music

"There was something about it, simple and true."


It's called The Song. Think of it as an allegory in the vein of The Old Man and the Sea or Animal Farm or The Stranger -- very minimally told, and short.

Thematically it is the story of how a new idea is introduced into the world. 

Plot-wise it is about a programmer at a huge corporate tech company (think Microsoft) who has a revolutionary idea for their existing social network software. His idea is basically a new form of communication using an amalgam of text, photos, video, and audio. He calls it The Song. So he goes through the political and bureaucratic channels to try to get managers interested in the idea, but everybody thinks its stupid, too difficult, not practical, or odd. So he gets frustrated, and eventually (from being too persistent) fired. 

So he decides to create a startup around the idea, with a couple guys from the company who thought it was cool. So they bootstrap a product called Song App, but it gets to a point where they need some money so they take investment. But the investors have all these ideas (like putting ads in the Song communication stream) and the programmer has to fight them off and eventually give back the money. Then, finally, when he is broke, and the other team members have left for paying jobs, the app is finally finished and released, and is a complete sensation. It does revolutionize mass communication, and makes a trillion dollars, goes IPO, all that stuff.

Then the story flash forwards fifteen years, and we learn the programmer has a terminal form of cancer. He makes arrangements as to who is going to run the company after he's gone, and finally dies. After his death, the new CEO tries the best he can but step by step they start to ruin simple idea behind The Song (first thing they do is introduce ads) and make it less and less the original idea. The company declines and loses its cool, no more users, and goes bankrupt, is bought out.

A coda ends the book, where five years later a young programmer is reading about old technologies and finds The Song App, and realizes it would be a good idea if the ads (and other crap) were stripped away.
