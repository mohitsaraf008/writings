THE SONG 
by Daniel Stepp

I.

That afternoon at work David accidentally clicked on a video file in his text editor and saw columns of sequenced numbers. It was at that moment the idea first occured to him, although the idea was not yet fully formed. Even so, a connection had been made somewhere in his brain that could not be undone. The germ of the idea was based on the realization that all communication media, be it video, photo, audio, or text was essentially the same thing to the computer. Nothing revolutionary there, he knew, but still. Something about his realization was fresh. Unique. And it would not leave him alone. Not at work. Not at home. Not at the karaoke bar with his friends, or mowing the grass at his mother's house on the weekend, or in bed at night with his girlfriend Anna. It was always pestering him, like an itch in the middle of your back, just out of reach.

David worked at MacroSystems as a programmer. MacroSystems was the company behind DigiFriend, the most popular social network on the Internet. Over six billion people used DigiFriend to communicate on a daily basis. David's work at MacroSystems involved multimedia persistence for DigiFriend, which meant storage and archival of all the photos, video, and audio which was uploaded to the network on a daily basis. Terabytes of data per day. It fascinated him to see various the ways people communicated through DigiFriend. 

David loved his work, was well paid, respected by his family and friends, and adored by his girlfriend Anna, a researcher at the CDC. He had a good life, and did not take it for granted.


No, do not tell the story, immerse in the world.
