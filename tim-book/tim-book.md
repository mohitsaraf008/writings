	There have been forty-five senior classes of football players at Georgia Tech since 1970. This is a recollection of that 1970 class who began their college career in 1967. Many teams during that span from 1967-1970 have had their famous and infamous atheletes who gained notoriety for their play on the field before or during that four year stretch.
	My class had several instances that were very public and some that were never shared with the outside observers. A few events were unique and memorable to our teams. Events in some cases were made public because of the extremely high profile of these players that came to Georgia Tech to play football under Bobby Dodd and Bud Carson.
	Two players in particular were the most highly touted high school players in the nation. One because of his achievement on the gridiron and the other because of his race.
	Stories exist about these atheletes that are rumor and most in the case of one is blatantly not true. Little known facts about the 1970 Sun Bowlâ€™s near cancellation are clarified in this book. Facts that are true and fact! I konw the truth about the Sun Bowl and the near cancellation of the game. I was in the middle of it. I have knowledge of the facts because I p(?) was a big part of all the turmoil that went along with the ? and the trip to play the game in El Paso : ? Sun Bowl Game.
