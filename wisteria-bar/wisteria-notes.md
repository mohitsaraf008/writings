THE WISTERIA BAR AT THE CORNER OF 23RD ST AND HIGHLAND AVE


Jefferson Cox

To those passersby illuminated by the womb-like glow of its windowfront on that late December evening it seemed like only the Wisteria Bar at the corner of 23rd Street and Highland Avenue was truly *inside*, and everywhere else was *outside*. At least it seemed that way to me. You know what I mean by that? You probably do. The bar was on the basement floor of its namesake hotel, now condemned, now home to junkies and dealers and those in between. Read in a newspaper the last legitimate resident checked out in 1992. But the bar was still there, thriving amid the squalor. A landmark in fact. Whenever a patron entered or exited the sound was like somebody turning up the volume on a movie about a party and then back down again, a chorus of drunken conversation and clinking glassware and jukebox rock â€™n roll behind it all. The smoke curled out the doorway and dissipated into the starry night sky. Tobacco smoke, thick and rich, the smell of it always promising something more than it gave.

To understand how I came to be at the Wisteria on that particular night, to do the thing I had come to do there, to understand why the bottom half of my Bogart trench coat was soaked through and why every pocket of it was full and heavy, to understand why the security guard around the corner had followed me here from Liberty Park at a suspicious distance, one hand on his radio, we ought to go back to the morning of that same day.

Glorious was the word.





Jefferson has been having nightmares about his mother for weeks, we learn. In his dreams she is angry at him. His friends tell him to find a man named Rickshaw who keeps a room at the old Wisteria Hotel. Rickshaw can help with things like that, they say. But you have to be prepared to leave something valuable with him, and not money. Something personal. Jefferson learns his room number and discovers that Rickshaw has committed suicide. The only clue he has is a photograph of a boy with a unique old hunter's hat standing with his mother.

When the time comes he jumps into a wish fountain in the middle of the park and steals handfuls and handfuls of change. A security guard chases him down an alleyway. He eludes the guard and makes his way to the Wisteria. Part One ends as he enters the bar.


Patrick Hermann

This part tells the story of an old writer who has just sold his first novel to a science fiction publisher. He is out alone celebrating at the Wisteria, remembering the trials and tribulations he went through. He has sold out. He wrote something from the heart, something "cosmic and true to life" but the publisher kept requesting changes, so he modified it and modified it until it no longer resembled anything he loved. The story concerned a spring on a distant planet whose waters restored youth to those who bathed in it. So what at first seemed a celebration becomes a mourning. "I am the cliche, sell-out, Judas of the world," he scribbles on a napkin. The writer is in love, or something, with a waitress who works at the Wisteria. He wants to take away the sadness he sees in her eyes, take away the memory of her drowned son. But he can never make a connection, it seems. This part ends with him missing a chance to talk to her, as the young man from part one enters the bar and shouts, "Drinks all around!"

Rosemary Webb

This part is from the perspective of the waitress. She tells the story of the night after the strange young man comes into the Wisteria with pockets stuffed with old change and buys drinks for everyone. She makes a lot of money and has a couple drinks herself. She has a crush on the old writer who is always there, but he never talks to her. Finally he leaves. She ends up dancing with the young man who came in. He reminds her of her drowned son Gabe. At the end of the night she takes him back to her apartment. He reminds her so much of her son that she doesn't want him to leave. They go to bed. She has a memory of one bright day in the park, at the fountain, when her son was still alive. "I never wanted that day to end," she remembers.
