THE WISTERIA BAR AT THE CORNER OF 23RD ST AND HIGHLAND AVE


Jefferson Cox

One

To those pedestrians illuminated by its windowfront lights that early September evening it was like only the Wisteria Bar at the corner of 23rd Street and Highland Avenue was truly *inside*, and everything else *outside*. At least to me it seemed that way. The bar was on the basement floor of its namesake hotel, now condemned, now home to junkies and dealers and those in between. A regional magazine article mentioned its last legitimate resident checked out in 2009. After that it was shut down for safety hazards. But the bar was still there, even thriving amid the squalor this side of town, the landmark of a bygone era. Whenever a patron entered or exited during those primetime hours it was like somebody turning up the volume on a party and then turning it right back down again, a chorus of drunken conversation, clinking glassware, and an old jukebox blaring vintage Springsteen or The Stones. As the door opened the smoke billowed out and dissipated against that late summer starlight - tobacco smoke, thick and rich, the smell of it always promising something more than it gave.

To understand how I came to be at the Wisteria on that particular night, to do the thing I had come to do there, to understand why the bottom half of my Bogart trenchcoat was soaked completely through and why every pocket on it was now full and heavy, to understand why the patrol car around the corner had followed me here from Liberty Park at a suspicious distance and why I hid from them behind a pole across the street, we should go back to the morning of that same day.

As usual I had not slept the night before. Dreams of my late mother haunted my dreams. Her angry, always. Shouting at me obsenities in a language I did not understand. Wailing and tearing at her hair and nightgown like a banshee. I loved her. I loved her more than I had ever let her know while she was still alive. On the good nights I got maybe two solid hours. On a bad one like that night I don't know, less than an hour for sure. Before the money ran out, before I came to live here under the overpass, the doctor's gave me pills to sleep and they worked but they made me angry inside. Then I took many pills. I couldn't handle the silence of the apartment we shared. The emptiness of that old place next to the stadium on the south side. To look at her things *after* was more than I could bear. The insignificant things were somehow the worst. Like the little spoon she used on her grapefruit at the kitchen table some mornings. I wept for an hour the first time I picked it out of the drawer by accident.

So the doctors in their kindness prescribed me antidepressents and sedatives and sleeping pills. And they worked until the money ran out, which it did fast because I did not work, had not worked for several years following a nervous breakdown in my early twenties. That was why I lived with her in the first place. But I was never able to get on disability. You get a lot of skeptical looks, impatient looks, a man in the prime of his life, healthy in body, says he can't hold a job. You just got to be lazy, they all think. They don't know what its like when your mind collapses and even the simplest task can overwhelm you and cause panic to set in. I did work at times. For awhile I had a part time job stocking at the bodega on Grant. Under the table cash. But my money went to Xannies, Klonopin, Ativan, any benzo will do.

He tells his history, how he can't sleep.
Speaks with Fat Randy, the leader of those who live under the causeway. Tells him to see the Rickshaw.
Visits the Wisteria Hotel where he finds the dead Rickshaw Man. Is seen.
Talks again with Fat Randy, who tells him he can't stay there anymore. Tells him to find the man in 
the photo, who probably knows something about it.
He sneaks back into the hotel and asks around about a man visiting. A hat. DM 1944-2011.
Police are following him through the park. He jumps into the fountain and fills his pockets with coins of 
every denomination. Then runs towards the Wisteria Bar.


They call him Pres.

Glorious was the word.


His friends tell him to find a man named Rickshaw who keeps a room at the old Wisteria Hotel. Rickshaw can help with things like that, they say. But you have to be prepared to leave something valuable with him, and not money. Something personal. Jefferson learns his room number and discovers that Rickshaw has committed suicide. The only clue he has is a photograph of a boy with a unique old hunter's hat standing with his mother.

When the time comes he jumps into a wish fountain in the middle of the park and steals handfuls and handfuls of change. A security guard chases him down an alleyway. He eludes the guard and makes his way to the Wisteria. Part One ends as he enters the bar.


Pat Hermann

This part tells the story of an old writer who has just sold his first novel to a science fiction publisher. He is out alone celebrating at the Wisteria, remembering the trials and tribulations he went through. He has sold out. He wrote something from the heart, something "cosmic and true to life" but the publisher kept requesting changes, so he modified it and modified it until it no longer resembled anything he loved. The story concerned a spring on a distant planet whose waters restored youth to those who bathed in it. So what at first seemed a celebration becomes a mourning. "I am the cliche, sell-out, Judas of the world," he scribbles on a napkin. The writer is in love, or something, with a waitress who works at the Wisteria. He wants to take away the sadness he sees in her eyes, take away the memory of her drowned son. But he can never make a connection, it seems. This part ends with him missing a chance to talk to her, as the young man from part one enters the bar and shouts, "Drinks all around!"

Rosemary Webb

This part is from the perspective of the waitress. She tells the story of the night after the strange young man comes into the Wisteria with pockets stuffed with old change and buys drinks for everyone. She makes a lot of money and has a couple drinks herself. She has a crush on the old writer who is always there, but he never talks to her. Finally he leaves. She ends up dancing with the young man who came in. He reminds her of her drowned son Gabe. At the end of the night she takes him back to her apartment. He reminds her so much of her son that she doesn't want him to leave. They go to bed. She has a memory of one bright day in the park, at the fountain, when her son was still alive. "I never wanted that day to end," she remembers.

One beautiful day forever.
